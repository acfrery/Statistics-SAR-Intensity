@article{AllendeFreryetal:JSCS:05,
	Abstract = {Many applications consecrate the use of asymmetric distributions, and practical situations often require robust parametric inference. This paper presents the derivation of M-estimators with asymmetric influence functions, motivated by the GA0 distribution. This law, regarded as the universal model for speckled imagery, can be highly skewed and maximum likelihood estimation can be severely hampered by small percentages of outliers. These outliers appear mainly because the hypothesis of independence and equal distribution of observations are seldom satisfied in practice; for instance, in the process of filtering, some pixels within a window frequently come from regions with different underlying distributions. Traditional robust estimation methods, on the basis of symmetric robustifying functions, assume that the distribution is symmetric, but when the data distribution is asymmetric, these methods yield biased estimators. Empirical influence functions for maximum likelihood estimators are computed, and based on this information we propose the asymmetric M-estimator (AM-estimator), an M-estimator with asymmetric redescending functions. The performance of AM estimators is assessed, and it is shown that they either compete with or outperform both maximum likelihood and Huber-type M-estimators.},

@inproceedings{CIARP2012GeneralizedStatisticalComplexitySARImagery,
	Abstract = {A new generalized Statistical Complexity Measure (SCM) was proposed by Rosso et al in 2010. It is a functional that captures the notions of order/disorder and of distance to an equilibrium distribution. The former is computed by a measure of entropy, while the latter depends on the definition of a stochastic divergence. When the scene is illuminated by coherent radiation, image data is corrupted by speckle noise, as is the case of ultrasound-B, sonar, laser and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In the amplitude and intensity formats, this noise is multiplicative and non-Gaussian requiring, thus, specialized techniques for image processing and understanding. One of the most successful family of models for describing these images is the Multiplicative Model which leads, among other probability distributions, to the law. This distribution has been validated in the literature as an expressive and tractable model, deserving the ``universal'' denomination for its ability to describe most types of targets. In order to compute the statistical complexity of a site in an image corrupted by speckle noise, we assume that the equilibrium distribution is that of fully developed speckle, namely the Gamma law in intensity format, which appears in areas with little or no texture. We use the Shannon entropy along with the Hellinger distance to measure the statistical complexity of intensity SAR images, and we show that it is an expressive feature capable of identifying many types of targets.},

An instance of the problem is defined by four street segments meeting at an intersection point, a street width, a node density at each street segment and a transmission range of the communication nodes. The problem that we focus on consists in computing the probability that there is a communication path connecting all four intersecting street segments. We propose a simplified model that approximates the connectivity properties in this setting and compute a lower bound for the connectivity probability. We compare our result to a Euclidean Line-of-Sight (LoS) model and show that our model provides an accurate approximation, while greatly simplifying the analytical treatment.},

@article{CharacterizationVehicleBehaviorInformationTheory,
	Abstract = {This work proposes the use of Information Theory for the characterization of vehicles behavior through their velocities. Three public data sets were used: (i) Mobile Century data set collected on Highway I-880, near Union City, California; (ii) Borl\"ange GPS data set collected in the Swedish city of Borl\"ange; and (iii) Beijing taxicabs data set collected in Beijing, China, where each vehicle speed is stored as a time series. The Bandt-Pompe methodology combined with the Complexity-Entropy plane were used to identify different regimes and behaviors. The global velocity is compatible with a correlated noise with $f^{-k}$ Power Spectrum with $k \ge 0$. With this we identify traffic behaviors as, for instance, random velocities ($k\approx 0$) when there is congestion, and more correlated velocities ($k \approx 3$) in the presence of free traffic flow.},

@article{SpeckleReductionwithAdaptiveStackFilters,
	Abstract = {Stack filters are a special case of non-linear filters. They have a good performance for filtering images with different types of noise while preserving edges and details. A stack filter decomposes an input image into stacks of binary images according to a set of thresholds. Each binary image is then filtered by a Boolean function, which characterizes the filter. Adaptive stack filters can be computed by training using a prototype (ideal) image and its corrupted version, leading to optimized filters with respect to a loss function. In this work we propose the use of training with selected samples for the estimation of the optimal Boolean function. We study the performance of adaptive stack filters when they are applied to speckled imagery, in particular to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. This is done by evaluating the quality of the filtered images through the use of suitable image quality indexes and by measuring the classification accuracy of the resulting images. We used Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images as input, since they are affected by speckle noise that makes classification a difficult task.},

	Abstract = {The spectral density is an important quantifier of the texture that, in turn, can be related to biophysical magnitudes. In this manner, it can be used to establish the kind of target being under observation. Some estimators for the spectral density of the return in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are studied using Monte Carlo experiences. These SAR images are contaminated by a particular kind of noise, called speckle, that does not obey the classical hypothesis of being Gaussian and of entering the signal in an additive manner requiring, thus, a careful treatment. There are two approaches to the problem of the presence of speckle noise, one being the use of techniques for its reduction (using specially devised filters) and the other the proposal of methodologies that take its presence into account. Both approaches will be used here, to the problem of estimating the spatial correlation structure of the ground truth under the presence of speckle noise. The performance of these estimators will be assessed using Monte Carlo experiences, since the problem is analytically intractable.},

	Abstract = {Correlated ${\cal G}$ distributions can be used to describe the clutter seen in images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of B-scan ultrasound, laser, sonar and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. These distributions are derived using the square root of the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution for the amplitude backscatter within the multiplicative model.
A two-parameter particular case of the amplitude ${\mathcal G}$ distribution, called ${\mathcal G}_{A}^{0}$, constitutes a modeling improvement with respect to the widespread ${\mathcal K}_{A}$ distribution when fitting urban, forested and deforested areas in remote sensing data. This article deals with the modeling and the simulation of correlated ${\mathcal G}_{A}^{0}$-distributed random fields. It is accomplished by means of the Inverse Transform method, applied to Gaussian random fields with spatial correlation.
The main feature of this approach is its generality, since it allows the introduction of negative correlation values in the resulting process, necessary for the proper explanation of the shadowing effect in many SAR images.},

This distribution has two unknown parameters related to the roughness and the scale of the signal, that can be used in image analysis and processing. It can be seen that Maximum Likelihood and moment estimators for its parameters can be influenced by small percentages of ``outliers''; hence, it is of outmost importance to find Robust Estimators for these parameters. One of the best-known classes of robust techniques is that of M-estimators, which are an extension of the Maximum Likelihood estimation method. In this work we derive the M-estimators for the parameters of the GA0 distribution, and compare them with maximum likelihood estimators with a Monte Carlo experience. It is checked that this robust technique is superior to the classical approach under the presence of corner reflectors, a common source of contamination in SAR images. Numerical issues are addressed, and a practical example is provided.},

Among the challenges they pose, the way data travel among them is a relevant issue since their structure is quite dynamic. The operational topology of such devices can often be described by complex networks. In this work, we assess the variation of measures commonly employed in the complex networks literature applied to wireless sensor networks. Four data communication strategies were considered: geometric, random, small-world, and scale-free models, along with the shortest path length measure. The sensitivity of this measure was analyzed with respect to the following perturbations: insertion and removal of nodes in the geometric strategy; and insertion, removal and rewiring of links in the other models. The assessment was performed using the normalized Kullback-Leibler divergence and Hellinger distance quantifiers, both deriving from the Information Theory framework. The results reveal that the shortest path length is sensitive to perturbations},

	Abstract = {Abstract Complex networks can model the structure and dynamics of different types of systems. It has been shown that they are characterized by a set of measures. In this work, we evaluate the variability of complex network measures face to perturbations and, for this purpose, we impose controlled perturbations and quantify their effect. We analyze theoretical models (random, small-world and scale-free) and real networks (a collaboration network and a metabolic networks) along with the shortest path length, vertex degree, local cluster coefficient and betweenness centrality measures. In such an analysis, we propose the use of three stochastic quantifiers: the Kullback--Leibler divergence and the Jensen--Shannon and Hellinger distances. The sensitivity of these measures was analyzed with respect to the following perturbations: edge addition, edge removal, edge rewiring and node removal, all of them applied at different intensities. The results reveal that the evaluated measures are influenced by these perturbations. Additionally, hypotheses tests were performed to verify the behavior of the degree distribution to identify the intensity of the perturbations that leads to break this property. },

The most complete format this type of imaging produces consists of complex-valued Hermitian matrices in every image coordinate and, as such, their visualization is challenging. They also suffer from speckle noise which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio. Smoothing techniques have been proposed in the literature aiming at preserving different features and, analogously, projections from the cone of Hermitian positive matrices to different color representation spaces are used for enhancing certain characteristics. In this work we propose the use of stochastic distances between models that describe this type of data in a Nagao-Matsuyama-type of smoothing technique. The resulting images are shown to present good visualization properties (noise reduction with preservation of fine details) in all the considered visualization spaces.},

The understanding of SAR imagery and scene element identification is an important objective in the field. In particular, reliable image contrast tools are sought. Aiming the proposition of new tools for evaluating SAR image contrast, we investigated new methods based on stochastic divergence. We propose several divergence measures specifically tailored for G0 distributed data. We also introduce a nonparametric approach based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance for G0 data. We devised and assessed tests based on such measures, and their performances were quantified according to their test sizes and powers. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we present a robustness analysis of test statistics and of maximum likelihood estimators for several degrees of innovative contamination. It was identified that the proposed tests based on triangular and arithmetic-geometric measures outperformed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov methodology.},

	Abstract = {This paper's aim is to evaluate the effectivess of bootstrap methods in improving estimation of clutter properties in speckled imagery. Estimation is performed by standard maximum likelihood methods. We show that estimators obtained this way can be quite biased in finite samples, and develop bias correction schemes using bootstrap resampling. In particular, we propose a bootstrapping scheme which is an adaptation of that proposed by Efron (1990). The proposed bootstrap does not require the quantity of interest to have closed-form, as does Efron's original proposal. The adaptation we suggest is particularly important since the maximum likelihood estimator of interest does not have a closed-form. We show that this particular bootstrapping scheme outperforms alternative forms of bias reduction mechanisms, thus delivering more accurate inference. We also consider interval estimation using bootstrap methods, and show that a particular parametric bootstrap-based confidence interval is typically more reliable than both the asymptotic confidence interval and other bootstrap-based confidence intervals. An application to real data is presented and discussed.},

The low cost and its presence in most mobile devices make Bluetooth technology one logical choice to be explored. Existing models neglect Bluetooth technical communication, FHSS -- Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum, and part of the challenge of generating efficient Scatternet algorithms is related to its characteristics. We propose a model of FHSS using dynamic graphs and we show the impact of its use in energy consumption and topology of these networks. We show that small changes in a centralized model of Scatternets lead to better traffic and consumption by making the resulting topology close to dynamic models.},

  abstract   = {Remote sensing data, and radar data in particular, have become an essential tool for environmental studies. Many airborne polarimetric sensors are currently operational, and many more will be available in the near future including spaceborne platforms. The signal-to-noise ratio of this kind of imagery is lower than that of optical information, thus requiring a careful statistical modelling. This modelling may lead to useful or useless techniques for image processing and analysis, according to the agreement between the data and their assumed properties. Several distributions have been used to describe synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Many of these univariate laws arise by assuming the multiplicative model, such as Rayleigh, square root of gamma, exponential, gamma, and the class of K distributions. The adequacy of these distributions depends on the detection (amplitude, intensity, complex, etc.), the number of looks, and the homogeneity of the data. In Frery et al. (1997), another class of univariate distributions, called G, was proposed to model extremely heterogeneous clutter, such as urban areas, as well as other types of clutter. This article extends the univariate family to the multivariate multi-look polarimetric situation: the Gp law. The new family has the classical polarimetric multi-look Kp distribution as a particular case, but another special case is shown to be more flexible and tractable, while having the same number of parameters and fully retaining their interpretability: G0p the law. The main properties of this new multivariate distribution are shown. Some results of modelling polarimetric data using the distribution are presented for two airborne polarimetric systems and a variety of targets, showing its expressiveness beyond classical models.},

Several classification strategies are compared in order to assess the importance of a careful statistical modeling of the data and the complementary nature of the information provided by different frequencies. Spatial context, which is relevant in order to obtain good results with noisy data, is described by means of the multiclass Potts model, and an iterated conditional modes classification algorithm that employs pseudolikelihood is proposed. The data are described using multivariate Gaussian laws and fully multilook polarimetric distributions arising from the multiplicative model. L-band, C-band, and both bands are used to assess the influence of dimensionality on the classification. Contextual and pointwise maximum-likelihood classifications are compared using real data. Results show that both context and number of frequencies contribute for better classification products, and that, a careful statistical description of the data leads to improved results.},

	Abstract = {This paper deals with numerical problems arising when performing maximum likelihood parameter estimation in speckled imagery using small samples. The noise that appears in images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of sonar, laser, ultrasound-B, and synthetic aperture radar, is called speckle, and it can neither be assumed Gaussian nor additive. The properties of speckle noise are well described by the multiplicative model, a statistical framework from which stem several important distributions. Amongst these distributions, one is regarded as the universal model for speckled data, namely, the G0 law. This paper deals with amplitude data, so the GA0 distribution will be used. The literature reports that techniques for obtaining estimates (maximum likelihood, based on moments and on order statistics) of the parameters of the GA0 distribution require samples of hundreds, even thousands, of observations in order to obtain sensible values. This is verified for maximum likelihood estimation, and a proposal based on alternate optimization is made to alleviate this situation. The proposal is assessed with real and simulated data, showing that the convergence problems are no longer present. A Monte Carlo experiment is devised to estimate the quality of maximum likelihood estimators in small samples, and real data is successfully analyzed with the proposed alternated procedure. Stylized empirical influence functions are computed and used to choose a strategy for computing maximum likelihood estimates that is resistant to outliers.},

Classification performance is hard to assess with generality due to the huge number of variables involved. We consider the problem of classifying multispectral optical imagery with pointwise Gaussian Maximum Likelihood (ML) and contextual ICM (Iterated Conditional Modes), with and without errors in the training stage. Two experimental setups were considered in order to assess the influence of using partial and low quality information and to make a quantitative comparison of ML and ICM in real situations. Using simulation the ground truth is known and, therefore, precise comparisons are possible. The contextual approach proved being superior than the pointwise one, at the expense of requiring more computational resources, with both real and simulated data. Pseudolikelihood parameter estimation for the context is used, and we provide the expression for estimating this parameter when using the multiclass Potts model with eight neighbours. Quantitative and qualitative results are discussed.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a methodology for navigation and exploration assistance intended to enhance user satisfaction when exploring three-dimensional virtual environments. The complexity of such environments often make navigation and information retrieval difficult, making it necessary to add assistance components to the world in order to turn it easier to manipulate. This methodology uses three-dimensional "intelligent" avatars as interactive guides, along with information based navigation strategies. The intelligence of the avatars is represented through physical features, behaviors and knowledge about the user and the environment. These components establish the avatar's architecture. Content personalization according to the user's interest, navigation assistance according to the desired content, and avatar guides that make the virtual place more realistic and pleasant are proposed in order to involve users.

Their densities are derived for complex and multilook intensity and amplitude data. Classical distributions, such as K, are particular cases of this new class. A special case of this class called here G0, that has as many parameters as K distributions, is shown able to model extremely heterogeneous clutter, such as that of urban areas, that cannot be properly modeled with K distributions. One of the parameters of this special case is related to the degree of homogeneity, and a limiting case is that of a scaled speckle. The advantage of the G0 distribution becomes evident through the analysis of a variety of areas (urban, primary forest and deforested) from two sensors.},

	Abstract = {The scaled complex Wishart distribution is a widely used model for multilook full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data whose adequacy is attested in this paper. Classification, segmentation, and image analysis techniques that depend on this model are devised, and many of them employ some type of dissimilarity measure. In this paper, we derive analytic expressions for four stochastic distances between relaxed scaled complex Wishart distributions in their most general form and in important particular cases. Using these distances, inequalities are obtained that lead to new ways of deriving the Bartlett and revised Wishart distances. The expressiveness of the four analytic distances is assessed with respect to the variation of parameters. Such distances are then used for deriving new tests statistics, which are proved to have asymptotic chi-square distribution. Adopting the test size as a comparison criterion, a sensitivity study is performed by means of Monte Carlo experiments suggesting that the Bhattacharyya statistic outperforms all the others. The power of the tests is also assessed. Applications to actual data illustrate the discrimination and homogeneity identification capabilities of these distances.},

Due to the phenomenon called `speckle', common to all images obtained with coherent illumination such as PolSAR imagery, accurate modelling is required in their processing and analysis. The scaled multilook complex Wishart distribution has proven to be a successful approach for modelling radar backscatter from forest and pasture areas. Classification, segmentation, and im- age analysis techniques, which depend on this model, have been devised, and many of them employ some kind of dissimilarity measure. Specifically, we introduce statistical tests for analyzing contrast in such images. These tests are based on the Bhattacharyya, chi-square, Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler and R Ìenyi distances. Results obtained by Monte Carlo experiments reveal the Kullback-Leibler distance as the best one with respect to the empirical test sizes under several situations which include pure and contaminated data. The proposed methodology is applied to actual data, obtained by an E-SAR sensor over surroundings of We{\ss}ling, Bavaria, Germany.},

Particle size generation is based on the statistical analysis of granulometric curves which are used as empirical cumulative distribution functions to sample from mixtures of uniform distributions. The desired porosity is attained by selecting a certain number of particles, and their placement is performed by a stochastic point process. We present an application analyzing different types of sand and clay, where we model the grain size with the gamma, lognormal, Weibull and hyperbolic distributions. The parameters from the resulting best fit are used to generate samples from the theoretical distribution, which are used for filling a finite-size area with non-overlapping disks deployed by a Simple Sequential Inhibition stochastic point process. Such filled areas are relevant as plausible inputs for assessing Discrete Element Method and similar techniques.},

One of the parameters of these distributions can be used to characterize the different degrees of roughness found in speckled data. We used this information to find boundaries between different regions within the image. Two different region contour detection methods for speckled imagery, are presented and compared. The first one maximizes a likelihood function over the speckled data and the second one uses anisotropic difussion over roughness estimates. To represent detected contours, the B-Spline curve representation is used. In order to compare the behaviour of the two methods we performed a Monte Carlo experience. It consisted of the generation of a set of test images with a randomly shaped region, which is considered in the literature as a difficult contour to fit. Then, the mean square error was calculated for each test image, for both methods.},

@article{Gambini:StatisticsComputing,
	Abstract = {We compare the accuracy of five approaches for contour detection in speckled imagery. Some of these methods take advantage of the statistical properties of speckled data, and all of them employ active contours using B-spline curves. Images obtained with coherent illumination are affected by a noise called speckle, which is inherent to the imaging process. These data have been statistically modeled by a multiplicative model using the G0 distribution, under which regions with different degrees of roughness can be characterized by the value of a parameter. We use this information to find boundaries between regions with different textures. We propose and compare five strategies for boundary detection: three based on the data (maximum discontinuity on raw data, fractal dimension and maximum likelihood) and two based on estimates of the roughness parameter (maximum discontinuity and anisotropic smoothed roughness estimates). In order to compare these strategies, a Monte Carlo experience was performed to assess the accuracy of fitting a curve to a region. The probability of finding the correct edge with less than a specified error is estimated and used to compare the techniques. The two best procedures are then compared in terms of their computational cost and, finally, we show that the maximum likelihood approach on the raw data using the G0 law is the best technique.},

	Abstract = {This article proposes a technique for boundary detection in speckled imagery based on active contours and on the statistical properties of speckled data. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), sonar, B-ultrasound and laser imagery is corrupted by a signal-dependent non-additive noise called speckle. Many statistical models have been proposed to describe this noise, aiming at the development of specialized techniques for image improvement and analysis. The G0 distribution is a statistical model that succeeds in describing a wide range of areas as, for instance in SAR data, pastures (smooth), forests (rough) and urban (extremely rough) areas. In order to determine boundaries between different areas, dynamic B-splines are proposed in this paper. The algorithm automatically finds seeds and regions boundaries by a decision rule based on the estimation of the parameters of the G0 law. The proposed algorithm is tested on synthetic and real SAR images, and both the accuracy and the performance of the proposal are assessed.},

	Abstract = {In this work we present a methodology for the refinement of segmentations of 2D magnetic resonance images. The algorithm proposed here begins with an initial segmentation and, through the addition and exclusion of pixels in the contour of the actual segmentation, the desired segmentation is obtained. At each step, two segmentations are available, the current and a candidate one. One of these two is selected according to deterministic (hybrid technique refinement) or stochastic (refinement by simulated annealing) minimization of an energy function. This function is composed of terms that account for the contrast in the contour, for the variance of the signal and for the shape of the segmented object. The methodology was evaluated over numeric phantoms and applied to real resonance magnetic images with success. This proposal can be easily extended to other kinds of image modalities.},

In dynamics, a time-adaptive strategy is a mechanism that interactively proposes changes to the time step used in iterative methods of solution. These changes aim to improve the relation between quality of response and computational cost. The method here proposed is suitable for a variety of numerical time integration problems, for example, in the study of bodies subjected to dynamical loads. The motion equation in its space-discrete form is used as reference to derive the formulation presented in this paper. Our method is contrasted with other ones based on local error estimator and apparent frequencies. We check the performance of our proposal when employed with the central difference, the explicit generalized- Ìš and the Chung-Lee integration methods. The proposed refinement estimator demands low computational resources, being easily applied to several direct integration methods.},

@article{ThermomechanicalEffectSaltRocks,
	Abstract = { Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of the effect of the temperature on the creep deformation during vertical well drilling in salt rocks in selected cases. Design/methodology/approach -- The authors performed numerical simulations by Finite Element Method, using non-linear viscoelastic models and weak thermomechanical coupling. The authors evaluated, in selected cases, the effect of temperature during salt rock vertical well drilling. Numerical examples were performed to validate the studies. More specifically, the authors considered the problem of vertical well drilling for oil exploration below these salt layers. Findings -- The authors concluded that the biggest reduction in the wellbore closure rate occurs when the wellbore is at low temperature with respect to the rock initial. This is due to two factors, namely, a reduced salt viscous strain rate and the thermal strain contrary to the well radial closure caused by the temperature variation. Beyond the creep effect, the thermal strain also affects the stress in the creep constitutive equation. Practical implications -- With recent oil discoveries in deep water, for example, in the pre-salt, where temperatures are high, the study of the influence of temperature is important, since it contributes to the increase of the creep. The results here presented are relevant, although the engineering aspects of a practical solution for reducing the wellbore displacement based on temperature variation is challenging. Such approach requires cooling mechanisms that delay the heating of the drilling fluid, which is surrounded by rocks at high temperature. Originality/value -- The main contribution of this paper is to present a numerical study, in selected cases, of the effect of temperature on the creep deformation during vertical well drilling in salt rocks, analyzing a possible reduction of these deformations when subjected to a temperature variation. },

@inproceedings{UpperOutliersAPSAR2015,
	Abstract = {A common assumption for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, is that the intensity return from textureless areas follows a Gamma law with mean Î» > 0 and L > 0 looks. Many image processing techniques need to estimate these parameters using small samples. Unfortunately, the presence of discrepant observations in SAR data occurs frequently, even when dealing with small samples. This is mostly caused by the presence of a small strong backscatterer as is the case of, for instance, a corner reflector. Processing techniques based on the estimation of the parameters of the sample distribution are highly influenced by the presence of such outlying observations. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to identify them before applying techniques based on parameter estimation. We discuss test statistics designed to detect the presence of an outlying observation in a gamma sample, and we propose a new test based on an empirical estimate of the underlying distribution.},

@article{FuzzyLogicEnhanceStereoMatchingMultiresolutionImages,
	Abstract = {Stereo matching is an open problem in Computer Vision, for which local features are extracted to identify corresponding points in pairs of images. The results are heavily dependent on the initial steps. We apply image decomposition in multiresolution levels, for reducing the search space, computational time, and errors. We propose a solution to the problem of how deep (coarse) should the stereo measures start, trading between error minimization and time consumption, by starting stereo calculation at varying resolution levels, for each pixel, according to fuzzy decisions. Our heuristic enhances the overall execution time since it only employs deeper resolution levels when strictly necessary. It also reduces errors because it measures similarity between windows with enough details. We also compare our algorithm with a very fast multi-resolution approach, and one based on fuzzy logic. Our algorithm performs faster and/or better than all those approaches, becoming, thus, a good candidate for robotic vision applications. We also discuss the system architecture that efficiently implements our solution.},

	Abstract = {Data from a coherent illumination system like a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be modelled by the multiplicative model. This model explains the characteristics of these data. The multiplicative model states that, under certain conditions, the constructive and destructive interferences of the incident and reflected signals give a return that varies, in a random manner, with the mean value of the backscatter corresponding to the illuminated target. The K distributions have been widely used to model data coming from a coherent illumination system, in particular for SAR images. These distributions allow us to model homogeneous as well as heterogeneous data. Given the need of finding a model for extremely heterogeneous data, a new class of distributions, the G distributions and a particular case the GA0 distributions have been recently proposed. These distributions model urban area very well, while K distributions do not fit this type of data. In this work, the feasibility of substituting the GA0 distribution for the KA distribution is studied and the practical usefulness of doing this will be shown. Once this fact is established, it will be possible to consider SAR images under the GA0 model only.},

@article{MejailJacoboFreryBustos:IJRS,
	Abstract = {Among the frameworks for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image modelling and analysis, the multiplicative model is very accurate and successful. It is based on the assumption that the observed random field is the result of the product of two independent and unobserved random fields: $X$ and $Y$. The random field $X$ models the terrain backscatter and, thus, depends only on the type of area each pixel belongs to. The random field $Y$ takes into account that SAR images are the result of a coherent imaging system that produces the well known phenomenon called speckle noise, and that they are generated by performing an average of n statistically independent images (looks) in order to reduce the noise effect. There are various ways of modelling the random field $X$; recently Frery et. al (1997) proposed the $\Gamma^{-1/2}(\alpha,\gamma)$ distribution. This, with the usual $\Gamma^{1/2}(n,n)$ distribution for the amplitude speckle, resulted in a new distribution for the return: the $\mathcal G_A^0(\alpha,\gamma,n)$ law. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ depend only on the ground truth, and n is the number of looks. The advantage of this istribution over the ones used in the past is that it models very well extremely heterogeneous areas like cities, as well as moderately heterogeneous areas like forests, and homogeneous areas like pastures as well. As the ground truth can be characterized by the parameters alpha and gamma, their estimation in each pixel generates parameter maps that can be used as the input for classification methods. In this work, moment estimators are used on simulated and on real SAR images and, then, a supervised classification technique (Gaussian maximum likelihood) is performed and evaluated. Excellent classification results are obtained.},

We study the nature of collective excitations in harmonic chains in the presence of aperiodic and pseudorandom mass distributions. Using the transfer matrix method and exact diagonalization on finite chains, we compute the localization length and the participation number of eigenmodes within the band of allowed frequencies. Our numerical calculations indicate that, for aperiodic arrays of masses, a new phase of extended states appears in this model. For pseudorandom masses distribution, all eigenstates remain localized except the uniform mode (omega=0). Solving numerically the Hamilton equations for momentum and displacement of the chain, we compute the spreading of an initially localized energy excitation. We show that, independent of the kind of initial excitation, an aperiodic structure of masses can induce ballistic transport of energy.},

	Abstract = {Images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of sonar, ultrasound-B, laser and Synthetic Aperture Radar -- SAR, are affected by speckle noise which reduces the ability to extract information from the data. Specialized techniques are required to deal with such imagery, which has been modeled by the G0 distribution and under which regions with different degrees of roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a third parameter, the number of looks, is related to the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image analysis; they provide grounds of the separability and, therefore, of the performance of classification procedures. This work derives and compares eight stochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that employ them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on the triangular distance have the closest empirical size to the theoretical one, while those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power. Since the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum, we conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis testing, even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and Bhattacharyya.},

	Abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery plays a central role as a source of unique data for Geographic Information Systems. These data sets provide complementary information to that provided by optical and infra-red sensors as, for instance, Landsat TM, CBERS-2, IKONOS and SPOT, to name a few. SAR sensors capture information about the target roughness and its dielectric properties, and their imaging capabilities are able to penetrate clouds, fog, rain and even some types of land cover as, for instance, forest canopies. A major issue related to the use of SAR images is their statistical behavior. It is well known that classical Gaussian and additive models do not hold for such data. The multiplicative model (MM) has been extensively tested with success, and it is able to explain phenomenological aspects of the image formation. One of the most important distributions related to the MM is the G0A law. The G0A distribution, as all other laws related to the MM, greatly departs from the Gaussian model. This paper assesses the SAR image discrimination capabilities of selected parametric methods based on divergences measures, when compared to the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing methodology. The importance of the Triangular and Arithmetic-Geometric distances is quantified with respect to the Kullback-Leibler parametric and Kolmogorov-Smirnov non-parametric classical distances by means of Monte Carlo simulation.},

	Abstract = {Images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of sonar, ultrasound-B, laser and Synthetic Aperture Radar -- SAR, are affected by speckle noise which reduces the ability to extract information from the data. Specialized techniques are required to deal with such imagery, which has been modeled by the G0 distribution and under which regions with different degrees of roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a third parameter, the number of looks, is related to the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image analysis; they provide grounds of the separability and, therefore, of the performance of classification procedures. This work derives and compares eight stochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that employ them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on the triangular distance have the the closest empirical size to the theoretical one, while those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power. Since the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum, we conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis testing, even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and Battacharyya.},

@article{BiasCorrectionModifiedProfileLikelihoodWishartDistribution,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes improved methods for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the equivalent number of looks L. This parameter has a meaningful interpretation in the context of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. Due to the presence of coherent illumination in their processing, PolSAR systems generate images which present a granular noise called speckle. As a potential solution for reducing such interference, the parameter L controls the signal-noise ratio. Thus, the proposal of efficient estimation methodologies for L has been sought. To that end, we consider first that a PolSAR image is well described by the scaled complex Wishart distribution. In recent years, Anfinsen have derived and analyzed estimation methods based on the ML and on trace statistical moments for obtaining the parameter L of the unscaled version of such probability law. This paper generalizes that approach. We present the second-order bias expression proposed by Cox and Snell for the ML estimator of this parameter. Moreover, the formula of the profile likelihood modified by Barndorff-Nielsen in terms of L is discussed. Such derivations yield two new ML estimators for the parameter L, which are compared to the estimators proposed by Anfinsen The performance of these estimators is assessed by means of Monte Carlo experiments, adopting three statistical measures as comparison criterion: the mean square error, the bias, and the coefficient of variation. Equivalently to the simulation study, an application to actual PolSAR data concludes that the proposed estimators outperform all the others in homogeneous scenarios.},

@article{EdgeDetectionDistancesEntropiesJSTARS,
	Abstract = {Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has achieved a prominent position as a remote imaging method. However, PolSAR images are contaminated by speckle noise due to the coherent illumination employed during the data acquisition. This noise provides a granular aspect to the image, making its processing and analysis (such as in edge detection) hard tasks. This paper discusses seven methods for edge detection in multilook PolSAR images. In all methods, the basic idea consists in detecting transition points in the finest possible strip of data which spans two regions. The edge is contoured using the transitions points and a B-spline curve. Four stochastic distances, two differences of entropies, and the maximum likelihood criterion were used under the scaled complex Wishart distribution; the first six stem from the       class of measures. The performance of the discussed detection methods was quantified and analyzed by the computa- tional time and probability of correct edge detection, with respect to the number of looks, the backscatter matrix as a whole, the SPAN, the covariance an the spatial resolution. The detection procedures were applied to three real PolSAR images. Results provide evidence that the methods based on the Bhattacharyya distance and the difference of Shannon entropies outperform the other techniques.},

	Abstract = {The user centric nature of mobile devices is an important issue for enhancing the user experience in a mobile wireless communication. A strategy for improving such experience consists of applying a resource management focused in providing both the user and the application valuable information about the network context. The communication quality in wireless systems heavily depends on several factors, and adjusting the application and/or alerting the user about the network conditions is an important service when managing this type of devices. The quality perceived by the user depends on the network context, which can be defined as the events that have significant impact on the wireless communication. The identification of the wireless channel behavior is necessary for obtaining a context description. Due to intrinsic features at the wireless signal propagation it is difficult to measure and assess the fundamental wireless network context, e.g., predicting when low quality signal is being caused by interference or fading effects. This work presents a new method for user centric management on IEEE 802.11b/g: a strategy for communication survival, focused in improving the user experience. Our proposal uses a multi-scale control chart approach, MCEWMA - Moving Centerline Exponential Weighted Moving Average, associated with multi-resolution analysis using a wavelet transform.},

@article{PercianoUltrasonics2012,
	Abstract = {Vibro-acoustography (VA) is a medical imaging method based on the difference-frequency generation produced by the mixture of two focused ultrasound beams. VA has been applied to different problems in medical imaging such as imaging bones, microcalcifications in the breast, mass lesions, and calcified arteries. The obtained images may have a resolution of 0.7-0.8 mm. Current VA systems based on confocal or linear array transducers generate C-scan images at the beam focal plane. Images on the axial plane are also possible, however the system resolution along depth worsens when compared to the lateral one. Typical axial resolution is about 1.0&#xa0;cm. Furthermore, the elevation resolution of linear array systems is larger than that in lateral direction. This asymmetry degrades C-scan images obtained using linear arrays. The purpose of this article is to study VA image restoration based on a 3D point spread function (PSF) using classical deconvolution algorithms: Wiener, constrained least-squares (CLSs), and geometric mean filters. To assess the filters' performance on the restored images, we use an image quality index that accounts for correlation loss, luminance and contrast distortion. Results for simulated VA images show that the quality index achieved with the Wiener filter is 0.9 (when the index is 1.0 this indicates perfect restoration). This filter yielded the best result in comparison with the other ones. Moreover, the deconvolution algorithms were applied to an experimental VA image of a phantom composed of three stretched 0.5&#xa0;mm wires. Experiments were performed using transducer driven at two frequencies, 3075 kHz and 3125 kHz, which resulted in the difference-frequency of 50&#xa0;kHz. Restorations with the theoretical line spread function (LSF) did not recover sufficient information to identify the wires in the images. However, using an estimated LSF the obtained results displayed enough information to spot the wires in the images. It is demonstrated that the phase of the theoretical and the experimental PSFs are dissimilar. This fact prevents VA image restoration with the current theoretical PSF. This study is a preliminary step towards understanding the restoration of VA images through the application of deconvolution filters.},

This subject has been studied in fields such as airborne traffic, computer vision, and wireless sensor networks. A VANET brings out new challenges that should be addressed. For instance, the cluttered and dense scenarios, communication issues such as short term links, and the variety of objects considered to be targets, are some of the new ingredients to be taken into account. Applications such as collision warning/avoidance systems require strict time constrains, while others impose only mild restrictions. This complex and heterogeneous environment is discussed in this work, where we didactically divide the main problems into four components: the targets' motion model, measurement models, data association problem, and filtering. We also discuss the communication issues and how they affect these systems.},

@article{TopologyRelatedMetricsForDesignWSNs,
	Abstract = {The use of topological features, more specifically, the importance of an element related to its structural position is a subject widely studied in the literature. For instance, the theory of complex networks provides centrality measures that have been applied to a large variety of fields (e.g., social sciences and biology). In this work, we propose a new topological measure, the Sink Betweenness (SBet), which stems from the theory of complex networks but is adapted to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to capture relevant information for this kind of network. We also provide a distributed algorithm to calculate it, and show its applicability to two different scenarios. The first one is focused on data-fusion applications for event-driven WSNs, where we devise a tree-based data-collection algorithm that takes advantage of node centrality to improve the data fusion efficiency. The second scenario is focused on energy balancing problems, more specifically in a problem called energy hole, where nodes closer to the sink are more likely to relay a larger number of packets than those that are further. This phenomenon is strongly related to the topology induced by the deployment of nodes along the sensor field, and it can be effectively captured by the SBet metric. Thus, we devise a data-collection algorithm that is able to distribute the relay task more evenly. Simulation results show that the SBet metric can be satisfactorily used in both scenarios. We compare the proposed approach with some of the most efficient available data fusion algorithms, and show that the proposed algorithm generates consistently good quality data-collection infrastructures, which require significant smaller overhead. The use of SBet allows to alleviate the energy hole effects by evenly balancing the relay load, and thus, increasing the network lifetime. These two applications illustrate how the topology awareness can be used to improve different network functions in a WSN.},

The architecture of a system for 3D generalization is proposed and the system is implemented. Differently from traditional cartographic processes, we use artificial intelligence for both selecting the key objects and applying the operators. As a case study, we present the simplification of the historical quarter of Recife (Brazil).},

We modify the gravitational edge detection technique (inspired by the Law of Universal Gravity) proposed by Lopez-Molina et al., using the non-standard neighbourhood configuration proposed by Fu et al., to reduce the speckle noise in polarimetric SAR imagery. We compare the modified and unmodified versions of the gravitational edge detection technique with the well-established one proposed by Canny, as well as with a recent multiscale fuzzy-based technique proposed by Lopez-Molina et al. We also address the issues of aggregation of gray level images before and after edge detection and of filtering. All techniques addressed here are applied to a mosaic built using class distributions obtained from a real scene, as well as to the true PolSAR image; the mosaic results are assessed using Baddeley's Delta Metric. Our experiments show that modifying the gravitational edge detection technique with a non-standard neighbourhood configuration produces better results than the original technique, as well as the other techniques used for comparison. The experiments show that adapting edge detection methods from Computational Intelligence for use in PolSAR imagery is a new field worthy of exploration.},

While the former offers mechanisms to model environment and characters physical features, the latter provides models and tools for building characters, namely Synthetic Actors or Believable Agents, which can exhibit intelligent social behavior and express personality and emotions. The current architecture proposals for Synthetic Actors do not fully meet the requirements for long-term games development. In long-term games, such as strategy and adventure ones, it is necessary to guarantee both personality stability and reactive emotional responses, which may be contradictory. In this work, we propose a new Synthetic Actor model that tightly connects emotions and social attitudes to personality},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a study of the stress field forming of sector array transducers for vibro-acoustography applications. The system point-spread function (PSF) is given in terms of the dynamic radiation stress exerted on a point target by a dual ultrasound beam with slightly different frequencies. The radiation stress is calculated by assuming that the resulting ultrasound beam is a plane wave. The stress is proportional to the product of the velocity potential of each incident ultrasound beam. The beamforming and stress field forming of sector array transducers are analyzed through linear acoustics. An expression for the velocity potential produced by sector array transducers is derived. The vibro-acoustography PSF is evaluated numerically. A comparison between the PSF of a sector array and a confocal transducers is presented. The compared characteristics of the PSF are sidelobe levels, transverse, and indepth spatial resolution. Indeed, one motivation to study sector transducers is the fact the depth-of-field of these transducers should be smaller than that of same size confocal transducers. An experimental setup was used to validate the theoretical PSF of sector array transducers. Results show that the measured PSF is in good agreement with the theoretical predications. Vibro-acoustography images of a breast-phantom by both transducers are presented and discussed.},

This distribution has been widely used in the modelling, processing and analysis of data corrupted by speckle noise, e.g., synthetic aperture radar images. Specifically, we consider the following modified profile likelihoods: (i) the one proposed by Cox & Reid (1987, 1989), and (ii) approximations to adjusted profile likelihood proposed by Barndorff-Nielsen (1983), namely the approximations proposed by Severini (1998, 1999) and one based on the results in Fraser & Reid (1995) and by Fraser et al. (1999). We focus on point estimation and on signalized likelihood ratio tests, the parameter of interest being the roughness parameter that indexes the distribution. As far as point estimation is concerned, the numerical evidence presented in the paper favors the Cox & Reid (1987, 1989) adjustment, and in what concerns signalized likelihood ratio tests, the results favor the approximation to Barndorff--Nielsen's adjustment based on the results in Fraser & Reid (1995) and Fraser et al.

	Abstract = {A new classifier for Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images is proposed and assessed in this paper. Its input consists of segments, and each one is assigned the class which minimizes a stochastic distance. Assuming the complex Wishart model, several stochastic distances are obtained from the $\hphi$ family of divergences, and they are employed to derive hypothesis test statistics that are also used in the classification process. This article also presents, as a novelty, analytic expressions for the test statistics based on the following stochastic distances between complex Wishart models: Kullback-Leibler, Bhattacharyya, Hellinger, R{\'e}nyi, and Chi-Square; also, the test statistic based on the Bhattacharyya distance between multivariate Gaussian distributions is presented. The classifier performance is evaluated using simulated and real PolSAR data. The simulated data are based on the complex Wishart model, aiming at the analysis of the proposal well controlled data. The real data refer to the complex L-band image, acquired during the 1994 SIR-C mission. The results of the proposed classifier are compared with those obtained by a Wishart per-pixel/contextual classifier, and we show the better performance of the region-based classification. The influence of the statistical modeling is assessed by comparing the results using the Bhattacharyya distance between multivariate Gaussian distributions for amplitude data. The results with simulated data indicate that the proposed classification method has a very good performance when the data follow the Wishart model. The proposed classifier also performs better than the per-pixel/contextual classifier and the Bhattacharyya Gaussian distance using SIR-C PolSAR data.},

The images were acquired during the first flight of the Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) experiment, in April 1994. L (24 cm)- and C (5 cm)-band SAR data at HH (horizontal transmitting and receiving), HV (horizontal transmitting, vertical receiving), and VV (vertical transmitting and receiving) polarizations both in ground range and slant range and in two different passes were analyzed. The kappa statistic was used to identify meaningful texture measures to discriminate seven classes. The results show that the classifications of land use based only on tonal averages produced a kappa coefficient only slightly higher than 0.50. A kappa threshold of 0.90 was reached with the simultaneous inclusion of 15 texture measures for the six images (two bands, three polarizations). It was also found that the inclusion of texture features when only one band and one polarization was used could produce kappa values higher than 0.85.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for filter design based on stochastic distances and tests between distributions. A window is defined around each pixel, samples are compared and only those which pass a goodness-of-fit test are used to compute the filtered value. The technique is applied to intensity Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, using the Gamma model with varying number of looks allowing, thus, changes in heterogeneity. Modified Nagao-Matsuyama windows are used to define the samples. The proposal is compared with the Lee's filter which is considered a standard, using a protocol based on simulation. Among the criteria used to quantify the quality of filters, we employ the equivalent number of looks (related to the signal-to-noise ratio), line contrast, and edge preservation. Moreover, we also assessed the filters by the Universal Image Quality Index and the Pearson's correlation between edges.},

@inproceedings{CIARP2012PolSARSmoothing,
	Abstract = {Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images are establishing as an important source of information in remote sensing applications. The most complete format this type of imaging produces consists of complex-valued Hermitian matrices in every image coordinate and, as such, their visualization is challenging. They also suffer from speckle noise which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio. Smoothing techniques have been proposed in the literature aiming at preserving different features and, analogously, projections from the cone of Hermitian positive matrices to different color representation spaces are used for enhancing certain characteristics. In this work we propose the use of stochastic distances between models that describe this type of data in a Nagao-Matsuyama-type of smoothing technique. The resulting images are shown to present good visualization properties (noise reduction with preservation of fine details) in all the considered visualization spaces.},

@article{TorresPolarimetricFilterPatternRecognition,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a technique for reducing speckle in Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) imagery using Nonlocal Means and a statistical test based on stochastic divergences. The main objective is to select homogeneous pixels in the filtering area through statistical tests between distributions. This proposal uses the complex Wishart model to describe PolSAR data, but the technique can be extended to other models. The weights of the location-variant linear filter are function of the $p$-values of tests which verify the hypothesis that two samples come from the same distribution and, therefore, can be used to compute a local mean. The test stems from the family of ($h$-$\phi$) divergences which originated in Information Theory. This novel technique was compared with the Boxcar, Refined Lee and IDAN filters. Image quality assessment methods on simulated and real data are employed to validate the performance of this approach. We show that the proposed filter also enhances the polarimetric entropy and preserves the scattering information of the targets.},

Questions such as the number of high-end sensors should be used, and how to deploy them, need proper assessment. In this work, we propose a novel model capable of representing a wide variety of scenarios, from totally random to planned stochastic node deployment in both homogeneous and heterogeneous sensor networks. In particular, this model encompasses networks with the characteristics of small-world networks. Using only about 3% of high-end sensors, and deploying nodes by using the slightly attractive model defined herein, we observe improved characteristics of the network topology, such as: (i) low average path length, (ii) high clustering coefficient, and (iii) improved relay task distribution among sensors. We also provide a guide for deploying nodes in order to improve the network lifetime, showing that the aforementioned model can be used to diminish the energy hole effect. Moreover, we evaluate a topological metric, namely Sink Betweenness, suitable for characterizing the relay task of a node.},

To that end, the G0I distribution is able to characterize a large number of targets. This distribution depends on three parameters: texture, scale, and the number of looks. The first has received special attention in the literature because it is closely related number of elementary backscatterers in the scene. In this paper we compare estimators for the texture parameter in the single look case. The single-look G0I law is a Pareto distribution whose tail index is related to the texture parameter, so we propose a tail index estimator. The estimators performance is analyzed in terms convergence, bias and mean squared error. Then we apply these estimators to actual data.},

@article{ClassificationVerificationOnlineHandwrittenSignatures,
	Abstract = {We present a new approach for handwritten signature classification and verification based on descriptors stemming from time causal information theory. The proposal uses the Shannon entropy, the statistical complexity, and the Fisher information evaluated over the Bandt and Pompe symbolization of the horizontal and vertical coordinates of signatures. These six features are easy and fast to compute, and they are the input to an One-Class Support Vector Machine classifier. The results are better than state-of-the-art online techniques that employ higher-dimensional feature spaces which often require specialized software and hardware. We assess the consistency of our proposal with respect to the size of the training sample, and we also use it to classify the signatures into meaningful groups.},

	Abstract = {The GI0 distribution is able to characterize different regions in monopolarized SAR imagery. It is indexed by three parameters: the number of looks (which can be estimated in the whole image), a scale parameter, and a texture parameter. This paper presents a new proposal for feature extraction and region discrimination in SAR imagery, using the geodesic distance as a measure of dissimilarity between GI0 models. We derive geodesic distances between models that describe several practical situations, assuming the number of looks known, for same and different tex- ture and for same and different scale. We then apply this new tool to the problems of identifying edges between regions with different texture, and quantify the dissimilarity between pairs of samples in actual SAR data. We analyze the advantages of using the geodesic distance when compared to stochastic distances.},

@article{UnassistedQuantitativeEvaluationDespecklingFilters,
	Abstract = {SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imaging plays a central role in Remote Sensing due to, among other important features, its ability to provide high-resolution, day-and-night and almost weather-independent images. SAR images are affected from a granular contamination, speckle, \mbox{that can} be described by a multiplicative model. Many despeckling techniques have been proposed in the literature, as well as measures of the quality of the results they provide. Assuming the multiplicative model, the observed image $Z$ is the product of two independent fields: the backscatter $X$ and the speckle $Y$. The result of any speckle filter is $\widehat X$, an estimator of the backscatter $X$, based solely on the observed data $Z$. 
An ideal estimator would be the one for which the ratio of the observed image to the filtered one $I=Z/\widehat X$ is only speckle: a collection of independent identically distributed samples from Gamma variates. We, then, assess the quality of a filter by the closeness of $I$ to the hypothesis that it is adherent to the statistical properties of pure speckle. We analyze filters through the ratio image they produce with regards to first- and second-order statistics: the former check marginal properties, while the latter verifies lack of structure. A new quantitative image-quality index is then defined, and applied to state-of-the-art despeckling filters. This new measure provides consistent results with commonly used quality measures (equivalent number of looks, PSNR, MSSIM, $\beta$ edge correlation, and preservation of the mean), and ranks the filters results also in agreement with their visual analysis. We conclude our study showing that the proposed measure can be successfully used to optimize the (often many) parameters that define a speckle filter.},

@article{SpatioTemporalWaterQuality,
	Abstract = {In this work we present novel results concerning water quality changes in an eutrophic water body connected with an artificial aeration system installed in it. Sixty one in-situ and laboratory measurements of biogeochemi- cal variables were recorded monthly between October 2008 and June 2011 to evaluate temporal and spatial changes in San Roque reservoir (Argentina). t-Student mean difference tests, carried out over the whole period, showed with 95% confidence that a monitoring point located at the centre of the water body is representative of the chemical behaviour of the reservoir. Thermal stratification was observed in all sampling sites in the summer, but the frequency of these episodes was markedly lower in bubbling zones. Mean chlorophyll-a concentrations were 58.9 ÎŒgÂ·dm--3 and 117.0 ÎŒgÂ·dm--3 in the absence and in the presence of thermocline respectively. According to the t-Student test, this difference was significant, with p < 0.001. Phosphate release from sediments was cor- roborated under hypoxia conditions. ANOVA one way analysis did not show significant spatial differences for any variable. Mean normalize spatial index (MENSI) was developed to compare data from different regions af- fected by high temporal variability. It proved to be useful to quantify spatial differences. Structure analysis of temporal series was used to scrutinize both chemical and spatial association successfully. Three chemically dif- ferent zones were determined in the reservoir. This study demonstrated that spatial comparisons by means of marginal statistics may not be an adequate method when high temporal variation is present. In such a case, tem- poral structure analysis has to be considered.},

It is also flexible in terms of the number ofelementary models against which an observed backscatteringmay be compared. Under this framework, the observed scatteringis evaluated in terms of scattering similarities whichprovide the dominance of scattering mechanisms. This isthen further utilized for a convex splitting of unity to obtainthe intermediate weights. This leads to the weights beingthe product of similarity and dissimilarity of the observedpixel with the elementary scattering models. Finally, theseweights are modulated with the total power (Span) to obtainthe non-negative scattering powers.

In this paper, we analyze the discriminatory power of Deep Feedforward Neural Networks (DFNN) when applied to DLDs. We classify six radiographic patterns related with DLDs: pulmonary consolidation, emphysematous areas, septal thickening, honeycomb, ground-glass opacities, and normal lung tissues. We analyze DFNN and other ML methods to compare their performance. The obtained results show the high performance obtained by DFNN method, with an overall accuracy of 99.60%, about 10% higher than the other studied ML methods. {\^A}{\copyright} Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

Silva et al. [``Classification of segments in PolSAR imagery by minimum stochastic distances between wishart distributions.'' IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing 6 (3): 1263--1273] used stochastic distances between complex multivariate Wishart models which, differently from other measures, are computationally tractable. In this work we assess the robustness of such approach with respect to errors in the training stage, and propose an extension that alleviates such problems. We introduce robustness in the process by incorporating a combination of radial basis kernel functions and stochastic distances with Support Vector Machines (SVM). We consider several stochastic distances between Wishart: Bhatacharyya, Kullback-Leibler, Chi-Square, R{\'e}nyi, and Hellinger. We perform two case studies with PolSAR images, both simulated and from actual sensors, and different classification scenarios to compare the performance of Minimum Distance and SVM classification frameworks. With this, we model the situation of imperfect training samples. We show that SVM with the proposed kernel functions achieves better performance with respect to Minimum Distance, at the expense of more computational resources and the need of parameter tuning. Code and data are provided for reproducibility. },

In particular, Aedes ægypti (Linnaeus) is the main vector forChikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Latin America and it represents a global threat. Public health policiesthat aim at combating this vector require dependable and timely information, which is usually expensive toobtain with field campaigns. For this reason, several efforts have been done to use remote sensing due to itsreduced cost. The present work includes the temporal modeling of the oviposition activity (measured weekly on50 ovitraps in a north Argentinean city) of Aedes ægypti (Linnaeus), based on time series of data extracted fromoperational earth observation satellite images. We use are NDVI, NDWI, LST night, LST day and TRMM-GPM rainfrom 2012 to 2016 as predictive variables. In contrast to previous works which use linear models, we employMachine Learning techniques using completely accessible open source toolkits. These models have the advantagesof being non-parametric and capable of describing nonlinear relationships between variables.Specifically, in addition to two linear approaches, we assess a support vector machine, an artificial neuralnetworks, a K-nearest neighbors and a decision tree regressor. Considerations are made on parameter tuning andthe validation and training approach. The results are compared to linear models used in previous works withsimilar data sets for generating temporal predictive models. These new tools perform better than linear approaches,in particular nearest neighbor regression (KNNR) performs the best. These results provide better alternativesto be implemented operatively on the Argentine geospatial risk system that is running since 2012.},

@article{DetectingChangesinFullyPolarimetricSARImagerywithStatisticalInformationTheory2019,
	Abstract = {Images obtained from coherent illumination processes are contaminated with speckle. A prominent example of such imagery systems is the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR). For such remote sensing tool the speckle interference pattern appears in the form of a positive definite Hermitian matrix, which requires specialized models and makes change detection a hard task. The scaled complex Wishart distribution is a widely used model for PolSAR images. Such distribution is defined by two parameters: the number of looks and the complex covariance matrix. The last parameter contains all the necessary information to characterize the backscattered data and, thus, identifying changes in a sequence of images can be formulated as a problem of verifying whether the complex covariance matrices differ at two or more takes. This paper proposes a comparison between a classical change detection method based on the likelihood ratio and three statistical methods that depend on information-theoretic measures: the Kullback-Leibler distance and two entropies. The performance of these four tests was quantified in terms of their sample test powers and sizes using simulated data. The tests are then applied to actual PolSAR data. The results provide evidence that tests based on entropies may outperform those based on the Kullback-Leibler distance and likelihood ratio statistics.},

Data simulation is crucial for the development of new methods of automatic interpretation of this type of images. We compare four alternatives for generating data under the GI0 distribution. The experiments are performed on a variety of programming languages and, a number of criteria to test the fidelity of the generated data are applied.},

@article{RevisitingtheEffectofSpatialResolutiononInformationContentBasedonClassificationResults2019,
	Abstract = {Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images are an important source of information. Speckle noise gives SAR images a granular appearance that makes interpretation and analysis hard tasks. A major issue is the assessment of information content in these kinds of images, and how it is affected by usual processing techniques. Previous works have resulted in various approaches for quantifying image information content. In this paper, we study this problem from the classification accuracy viewpoint, focusing on the filtering and the classification stages. Thus, through classified images, we verify how changing the properties of the input data affects their quality. The input is an actual PolSAR image, the control parameters are (i) the filter (Local Mean, LM, or Model-Based PolSAR, MBPolSAR) and the size of their support, and (ii) the classification method (Maximum Likelihood, ML, or Support Vector Machine, SVM), and the output is the precision of the classification algorithm applied to the filtered data. To expand the conclusions, this study deals not only with Classification Accuracy but also with Kappa and Overall Accuracy as measures of map precision. Experiments were conducted on two airborne PolSAR images. Differently from what was observed in previous works, almost all quality measures are good and increase with degradation, i.e. the filtering algorithms that we used always improve the classification results at least up to supports of size 7 Ã 7. },

  Abstract                 = {Este fragmento textual propÃµe uma reflexÃ£o crÃ­tica Ã  concepÃ§Ã£o monista comumente adotada na metodologia aplicada Ã s ciÃªncias de um modo geral. A sua reduÃ§Ã£o Ã  racionalidade cognitivo-instrumental resultou em uma complexidade para as ciÃªncias: ao mesmo tempo, instituiu a excessiva cientificizaÃ§Ã£o do conhecimento e recriou os problemas sociais da prÃ©-modernidade. Diante desta crise do paradigma da racionalidade cientÃ­fica dominante, surge uma concepÃ§Ã£o humanista das ciÃªncias que coloca a pessoa no centro do conhecimento, como autor e sujeito do mundo a partir de uma concepÃ§Ã£o metodolÃ³gica pluralista.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter presents a number of different aspects related to a particular kind of large and complex networks: A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of a large number of nodes that individually have limited computing power and information; their interaction is strictly local, but their task is to build global structures and pursue global objectives. Dealing with WSNs requires a mixture of theory and practice, i.e., a combination of algorithmic foundations with simulations and experiments that has been the subject of our project SwarmNet. In the first part, we describe a number of fundamental algorithmic issues: boundary recognition without node coordinates, clustering, routing, and energy-constrained flows. The second part deals with the simulation of large-scale WSNs; we describe the most important challenges and how they can be tackled with our network simulator Shawn.},

  abstract  = {The information and distance measures are useful to provide probability of error bounds, especially when the exact error probability is not available or too difficult to compute. They axe also useful for feature selection and ordering in pattern recognition such that the error probability is indirectly minimized. This paper provides a fairly complete list of information and distance measures including a new average conditional cubic entropy proposed by the author. Major problem areas such as computation with these measures are examined and methods of approach for the unresolved problems axe suggested. Error bounds on feature subset selection and on one-dimensional Laplacian and Gaussian densities are also considered.},

They are categorized into pixel difference-based, correlation-based, edge-based, spectral-based, context-based and human visual system (HVS)-based measures. Furthermore we compare these measures statistically for still image compression applications. The statistical behavior of the measures and their sensitivity to coding artifacts are investigated via analysis of variance techniques. Their similarities or differences are illustrated by plotting their Kohonen maps. Measures that give consistent scores across an image class and that are sensitive to coding artifacts are pointed out. It was found that measures based on the phase spectrum, the multiresolution distance or the HVS filtered mean square error are computationally simple and are more responsive to coding artifacts. We also demonstrate the utility of combining selected quality metrics in building a steganalysis tool.},

The speckle distribution in the SAR image is modeled by a Gamma function. Thus, the SAR image histogram exhibits a combination of Gamma distributions. The maximum likelihood technique is therefore used to estimate the histogram parameters. This technique requires knowledge of the number of modes of the histogram, the number of looks of the SAR image, and the initial parameters of the histogram. The second derivative of the histogram is used to estimate the number of modes. We use two methods to estimate the number of looks. Initial parameters are estimated at the maximum of the Gamma function. Thresholds are selected at the valleys of a multi-modal histogram by minimizing the discrimination error between the classes of pixels in the image. The algorithm is applied to several RADARSAT SAR images with di},

  abstract = {This work addresses the problem of covariance matrix estimation for adaptive radar detection in correlated heavy tailed clutter. The clutter is modeled as a compound-Gaussian process with unknown statistics. An approximate maximum likelihood (AML) estimator is derived and compared to the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator; their calculation requires the iterative solution of a transcendental equation whose numerical convergence is obtained through the introduction of a constraint in the iteration. The performance of the two "constrained" algorithms is evaluated in terms of the Frobenius norm of the error matrix, of the computational complexity (i.e., the number of iterations), and of the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property of the adaptive detector which makes use of them. Numerical results show that the AML estimator can be calculated with a very small number of iterations, it has a negligible performance loss with respect to the ML and less computational complexity. Finally, the AML guarantees the desired CFAR property to the detector.},

  Abstract                 = {Speckle filter performance depends strongly on the speckle and scene models used as the basis for filter development. These models implicitly incorporate certain assumptions about speckle, scene, and observed signals. In this study, the multiplicative and the product speckle models, which have been used for the development of most of the well-known filters, are analyzed, and their implicit assumptions with regard to the stationarity-nonstationarity nature of speckle are discussed. This leads to the definition of two categories of speckle filters: the stationary and the nonstationary multiplicative speckle model filters. The various approximate models used for the multiplicative speckle noise model are assessed as functions of speckle and scene characteristics to derive the requirements on scene signal variations for the validity of both the stationary and nonstationary multiplicative speckle models. Speckle filtering is then studied in the context of estimation theory, so as to develop a procedure for speckle filtering. It is shown that speckle filtering can be effective only in locally stationary scenes. Regions in which the signals are not stationary have to be filtered separately using a priori scene templates for the best matching of nonstationary scene features. The use of multiresolution techniques is crucial for accurate estimation of filter parameters. Under the guidance of the speckle filtering procedure, structural-multiresolution versions of the Lee (1980) and Frost et al. (1982) filters are developed for optimum application of these filters in the context of nonstationary scene signals.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new universal objective image quality index, which is easy to calculate and applicable to various image processing applications. Instead of using traditional error summation methods, the proposed index is designed by modeling any image distortion as a combination of three factors: loss of correlation, luminance distortion, and contrast distortion. Although the new index is mathematically defined and no human visual system model is explicitly employed, our experiments on various image distortion types indicate that it performs significantly better than the widely used distortion metric mean squared error. Demonstrative images and an efficient MATLAB implementation of the algorithm are available online at http://anchovy.ece.utexas.edu//spl sim/zwang/research/quality_index/demo.html.},

The data of an individual node is transmitted to the host node via acoustic waves using intermediate nodes as relays. Each node of the sensor network is a data router, and contains sensors capable of measuring environmental parameters of interest. Depending upon the required application, each sensor node can be equipped with different types of physical, biological or chemical sensors, allowing long-term, wide area, in situ multi-parameter monitoring. In this work the aqueous sensor network is described, with application to pH measurement using magnetoelastic sensors. Beyond ensuring drinking water safety, possible applications for the aqueous sensor network include advanced industrial process control, monitoring of aquatic biological communities, and monitoring of waste-stream effluents.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides the derivation of speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD), a diffusion method tailored to ultrasonic and radar imaging applications. SRAD is the edge-sensitive diffusion for speckled images, in the same way that conventional anisotropic diffusion is the edge-sensitive diffusion for images corrupted with additive noise. We first show that the Lee and Frost filters can be cast as partial differential equations, and then we derive SRAD by allowing edge-sensitive anisotropic diffusion within this context. Just as the Lee (1980, 1981, 1986) and Frost (1982) filters utilize the coefficient of variation in adaptive filtering, SRAD exploits the instantaneous coefficient of variation, which is shown to be a function of the local gradient magnitude and Laplacian operators. We validate the new algorithm using both synthetic and real linear scan ultrasonic imagery of the carotid artery. We also demonstrate the algorithm performance with real SAR data. The performance measures obtained by means of computer simulation of carotid artery images are compared with three existing speckle reduction schemes. In the presence of speckle noise, speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion excels over the traditional speckle removal filters and over the conventional anisotropic diffusion method in terms of mean preservation, variance reduction, and edge localization.},

  abstract = {{Few companies have a clear strategic vision. The problem, say the
   authors, stems from the strategic-planning process itself, which usually
   involves preparing a large document, culled from a mishmash of data
   provided by people with conflicting agendas. That kind of process almost
   guarantees an unfocused strategy. Instead, companies should design the
   strategic-planning process by drawing a picture: a strategy canvas.
   A strategy canvas shows the strategic profile of your industry by
   depicting the various factors that affect competition. And it shows the
   strategic profiles of your current and potential competitors as well as
   your own company's strategic profile - how it invests in the factors of
   competition and how it might in the future. The basic component of a
   strategy canvas - the value curve - is a tool the authors created in
   their consulting work and have written about in previous HBR articles.
   This article introduces a four-step process for actually drawing and
   discussing a strategy canvas. Readers will learn how one European
   financial services company used this process to create a distinct and
   easily communicable strategy.
   The process begins with a visual awakening. Managers compare their
   business's value curve with competitors' to discover where their
   strategy needs to change. in the next step-visual exploration-managers
   do field research on customers and alternative products. At the visual
   strategy fair, the third step, managers draw new strategic profiles
   based on field observations and get feedback from customers and peers
   about these new proposals. Once the best strategy is created from that
   feedback, it's time for the last step-visual communication. Executives
   distribute ``before{''} and ``after{''} strategic profiles to the whole
   company, and only projects that will help move the company closer to the
   ``after{''} profile are supported.}},

  Abstract                 = {Although sensor planning in computer vision has been a subject of research for over two decades, a vast majority of the research seems to concentrate on two particular applications in a rather limited context of laboratory and industrial workbenches, namely 3D object reconstruction and robotic arm manipulation. Recently, increasing interest is engaged in research to come up with solutions that provide wide-area autonomous surveillance systems for object characterization and situation awareness, which involves portable, wireless, and/or Internet connected radar, digital video, and/or infrared sensors. The prominent research problems associated with multisensor integration for wide-area surveillance are modality selection, sensor planning, data fusion, and data exchange (communication) among multiple sensors. Thus, the requirements and constraints to be addressed include far-field view, wide coverage, high resolution, cooperative sensors, adaptive sensing modalities, dynamic objects, and uncontrolled environments. This article summarizes a new survey and analysis conducted in light of these challenging requirements and constraints. It involves techniques and strategies from work done in the areas of sensor fusion, sensor networks, smart sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), photogrammetry, and other intelligent systems where finding optimal solutions to the placement and deployment of multimodal sensors covering a wide area is important. While techniques covered in this survey are applicable to many wide-area environments such as traffic monitoring, airport terminal surveillance, parking lot surveillance, etc., our examples will be drawn mainly from such applications as harbor security and long-range face recognition.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses estimation of the equivalent number of looks (ENL), an important parameter in statistical modeling of multilook synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Two new ENL estimators are discovered by looking at certain moments of the multilook polarimetric covariance matrix, which is commonly used to represent multilook polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data, and assuming that the covariance matrix is complex Wishart distributed. First, a second-order trace moment provides a polarimetric extension of the ENL definition and also a matrix-variate version of the conventional ENL estimator. The second estimator is obtained from the log-determinant matrix moment and is also shown to be the maximum likelihood estimator under the Wishart model. It proves to have much lower variance than any other known ENL estimator, whether applied to single-polarization or PolSAR data. Moreover, this estimator is less affected by texture and thus provides more accurate results than other estimators should the assumption of Gaussian statistics for the complex scattering coefficients be violated. These are the first known estimators to use the full covariance matrix as input, rather than individual intensity channels, and therefore to utilize all the statistical information available. We finally demonstrate how an ENL estimate can be computed automatically from the empirical density of small sample estimates calculated over a whole scene. We show that this method is more robust than procedures where the estimate is calculated in a manually selected region of interest.},

  Abstract                 = {Image processing researchers commonly assert that "median filtering is better than linear filtering for removing noise in the presence of edges." Using a straightforward large-n decision-theory framework, this folk-theorem is seen to be false in general. We show that median filtering and linear filtering have similar asymptotic worst-case mean-squared error (MSE) when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is of order 1, which corresponds to the case of constant per-pixel noise level in a digital signal. To see dramatic benefits of median smoothing in an asymptotic setting, the per-pixel noise level should tend to zero (i.e., SNR should grow very large).

We show that a two-stage median filtering using two very different window widths can dramatically outperform traditional linear and median filtering in settings where the underlying object has edges. In this two-stage procedure, the first pass, at a fine scale, aims at increasing the SNR. The second pass, at a coarser scale, correctly exploits the nonlinearity of the median.

Image processing methods based on nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are often said to improve on linear filtering in the presence of edges. Such methods seem difficult to analyze rigorously in a decision-theoretic framework. A popular example is mean curvature motion (MCM), which is formally a kind of iterated median filtering. Our results on iterated median filtering suggest that some PDE-based methods are candidates to rigorously outperform linear filtering in an asymptotic framework.},

The goal of this paper is to provide guidance to investigators, who are developing their own custom scientific software built upon numerical libraries written by others. Specifically, we evaluate the accuracy of small tail areas from cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the Chi-square and t-distribution by comparing several open-source, free, or commercially licensed numerical libraries in Java, C, and R to widely accepted standards of comparison like ELV and DCDFLIB. In our evaluation, the C libraries and R functions are consistently accurate up to six significant digits. Amongst the evaluated Java libraries, Colt is the most accurate. These languages and libraries are popular choices among programmers developing scientific software, so the results herein can be useful to programmers in choosing libraries for CDF accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) enable new applications and require non-conventional paradigms for protocol design due to several constraints. Owing to the requirement for low device complexity together with low energy consumption (i.e., long network lifetime), a proper balance between communication and signal/data processing capabilities must be found. This motivates a huge effort in research activities, standardization process, and industrial investments on this field since the last decade. This survey paper aims at reporting an overview of WSNs technologies, main applications and standards, features in WSNs design, and evolutions. In particular, some peculiar applications, such as those based on environmental monitoring, are discussed and design strategies highlighted; a case study based on a real implementation is also reported. Trends and possible evolutions are traced. Emphasis is given to the IEEE 802.15.4 technology, which enables many applications of WSNs. Some example of performance characteristics of 802.15.4-based networks are shown and discussed as a function of the size of the WSN and the data type to be exchanged among nodes.},

  Abstract                 = {The characteristics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image texture may be related to the properties of underlying elemental scene scatterers through established models based on the properties of a backscattering coefficient (in this paper, we use and unnormalized coefficient s) of these scatterers. In this paper, we generate raw SAR data by simulating the statistical characteristics of elemental scene scatterers such as the order of the gamma distribution, the form and length of their spatial correlation, and their spatial density. This simulation is carried out using a SAR signal simulation system called cSAR. We describe a particular set of methods to simulate image texture used in cSAR, and provide a detailed analysis of simulated s and of the speckle and texture characteristics of simulated images. We found that the distribution of s was strongly affected by the order, density, and correlation length of the underlying scatterers. We found that the simulated SAR images were consistently K-distributed as expected. The estimated image order was a strong function of the scattering properties and that the estimated image order is a relatively weak descriptor of image texture when used on its own. The correspondence between the observed image autocorrelation function (ACF) and the theoretical models of Oliver is excellent, and we could estimate the scatterer correlation length by fitting the Oliver model to the observed ACF. We combined the estimated image order and correlation length and found potential for using these two image texture descriptors in classification and segmen- tation algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Image denoising is an important problem in image processing since noise may interfere with visual or automatic interpretation. This paper presents a new approach for image denoising in the case of a known uncorrelated noise model. The proposed filter is an extension of the nonlocal means (NL means) algorithm introduced by Buades, which performs a weighted average of the values of similar pixels. Pixel similarity is defined in NL means as the Euclidean distance between patches (rectangular windows centered on each two pixels). In this paper, a more general and statistically grounded similarity criterion is proposed which depends on the noise distribution model. The denoising process is expressed as a weighted maximum likelihood estimation problem where the weights are derived in a data-driven way. These weights can be iteratively refined based on both the similarity between noisy patches and the similarity of patches extracted from the previous estimate. We show that this iterative process noticeably improves the denoising performance, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratio images such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Numerical experiments illustrate that the technique can be successfully applied to the classical case of additive Gaussian noise but also to cases such as multiplicative speckle noise. The proposed denoising technique seems to improve on the state of the art performance in that latter case.},

Independently of the unwrapping problem, interferometric phase denoising is a difficult task due to shadows and discontinuities. In this paper, we propose to jointly filter phase and amplitude data in a Markovian framework. The regularization term is expressed by the minimization of the total variation and may combine different information (phase, amplitude, optical data). First, a fast and approximate optimization algorithm for vectorial data is briefly presented. Then, two applications are described. The first one is a direct application of this algorithm for 3-D reconstruction in urban areas with very high resolution images. The second one is an adaptation of this framework to the fusion of SAR and optical data. Results on aerial SAR images are presented.},

Knowing that none of the previous detection methods has managed to fully meet these requirements, it is necessary to devise a new technique for guiding and speeding up the clean-up process of oil spills. This paper presents a sensor device that is capable of sensing, processing, and transmitting information about an oil spill (location and thickness). This paper discusses two new methodologies of detection based on the difference in the absorbance spectral signatures and electric conductivity properties of oil and water. This paper also discusses the mechanical design of the device, the hardware implementation of its components, and the integration and evaluation of the whole system. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method under different lighting, salinity, temperature, and sea conditions.},

We find strong indications, from multiple corroborating methods, of low-dimensional dynamics in the per- formance of a simple program running on a popular Intel computer -including the first experimental evidence of chaotic dynamics in real computer hardware. We also find that the dynamics change completely when we run the same program on a different type of Intel computer, or when that program is changed slightly. This not only validates our framework; it also raises important issues about computer analysis and design. These engineered systems have grown so complex as to defy the analysis tools that are typically used by their designers: tools that assume linearity and stochasticity and essentially ignore dynamics. The ideas and methods developed by the nonlinear dynamics community, applied and interpreted in the context of the framework proposed here, are a much better way to study, understand, and design modern computer systems},

For these networks, routing algorithms depend on the characteristics of the applications and, consequently, there is no self-contained algorithm suitable for every case. In some scenarios, the network behavior (traffic load) may vary a lot, such as an event-driven application, favoring different algorithms at different instants. This work presents a hybrid and adaptive algorithm for routing in WSNs, called Multi-MAF, that adapts its behavior autonomously in response to the variation of network conditions. In particular, the proposed algorithm applies both reactive and proactive strategies for routing infrastructure creation, and uses an event-detection estimation model to change between the strategies and save energy. To show the advantages of the proposed approach, it is evaluated through simulations. Comparisons with independent reactive and proactive algorithms show improvements on energy consumption.},

The procedure incorporates an adaptive target mask and uses a superresolution algorithm to identify the cross-range positions of target scattering centers. These are used to generate a pseudoimage of the target whose low-order discrete cosine transform coefficients form the recognizer feature vector. Within the recognizer, the states of a hidden Markov model (HMM) are used to represent the target orientation and a Gaussian mixture model is used for the feature vector distribution. In a closed-set identification experiment, the misclassification rate for ten MSTAR targets was 2.8%. Also presented are results from open-set experiments and investigates the effect on recognizer performance of variations in feature vector dimension, azimuth aperture, and target variants.},

This facilitates the node to intelligently monitor a medical signal for impending events instead of transmitting the signal to the base station constantly. Lowering the transmission data rate decreases the transmission power consumption in a node, thereby lengthening the node life and in turn increasing the reliability of the network. This work also implements a thresholding technique, which controls the data transmission rate depending on the value of the monitored signal, and a cardiac monitoring system that performs computations at the node for the detection of either a skipped heart beat or a reduced heart rate variability, in which event the signal is transmitted to the base station for monitoring/recording or alerting the crew. The performance analysis of the system shows that there are reductions in the system power consumption and data transmission rate, which in turn reduces the network traffic and averts congestion.},

  Abstract                 = {Many elder patients have multiple health conditions such as heart attacks (of various kinds), brain problems (such as seizure, mental disorder, etc.), high blood pressure, etc. Monitoring those conditions needs different types of sensors for analog signal data acquisition, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) for heart beats, electroencephalogram (EEG) for brain signals, and electromyogram (EMG) for muscles motions. To reduce mobile-health (m-health) cost, the above sensors should be made in tiny size, low memory, and long-term battery operations. We have designed a series of medical sensors with wireless networking capabilities. In this paper, we report our work in three aspects: (1) networked embedded system design, (2) network congestion reduction, and (3) network loss compensation. First, for networked embedded system design, we have designed an integrated wireless sensor network hardware / software platform for multi-condition patient monitoring. Such a system integrates ECG/EEG/other sensors with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) into a Radio Frequency (RF) board through a programmable interface chip, called PSoc. Second, for network congestion reduction, the interface chip can use compressive signal processing to extract bio-signal feature parameters and only transmit those parameters. This provides an alternative approach to sensor network congestion reduction that aims to alleviate ``hot spot{''} issues. Third, for network loss compensation, we have designed wireless loss recovery schemes for different situations as follows. (1) If original sensor data streams are transmitted, network congestion will be a big concern due to the heavy traffic. A receiver-only loss prediction will be a good solution. (2) If the signal parameters are transmitted, the transmission loss mandates a 100\% recovery rate. We have comprehensively compared the performance of those schemes. The proposed mechanisms for m-health system have potentially significant impacts on today's elder nursing home management and other mobile patient monitoring applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advanced production facilities have utilized networked sensors, which are increasingly designed as e-Work networks with sensor collaboration. Especially, wireless networked microsensors network have been developed and are about to gain widespread use as technology and reliability improve and prices drop. Especially, the redundantly distributed microsensor-based system can significantly and cost-effectively improve the quality of service, processes, and productivity in automated production systems. Besides energy consumption and scalability, a major design challenge, however, is that they must be designed to be adaptable for industrial applications. Most industrial applications require better reliability in communication, robustness to various interferences, fault tolerance, and the geometry of the production facility that collaborating sensors are implemented. Thus, this research proposes a sensor network middleware structure that automated production systems require. The middleware supports optimal or near-optimal multi-sensor deployment scheme and provides solutions for geometry-specific wireless microsensor deployment design. The middleware model is also supported by collaborative e-work network framework. Network design parameters such as the number of sensors, geometry of production facility are being considered to improve reliability of sensory data and to minimize the overall energy consumption under given geometry.

However, deficiencies were discovered in producing biased estimation and in blurring and depressing strong reflected targets. The advancement of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology with high-resolution data of large dimensions demands better and efficient speckle filtering algorithms. In this paper, we extend and improve the Lee sigma filter by eliminating these deficiencies. The bias problem is solved by redefining the sigma range based on the speckle probability density functions. To mitigate the problems of blurring and depressing strong reflective scatterers, a target signature preservation technique is developed. In addition, we incorporate the minimum-mean-square-error estimator for adaptive speckle reduction. Simulated SAR data are used to quantitatively evaluate the characteristics of this improved sigma filter and to validate its effectiveness. The proposed algorithm is applied to spaceborne and airborne SAR data to demonstrate its overall speckle filtering characteristics as compared with other algorithms. This improved sigma filter remains simple in concept and is computationally efficient but without the deficiencies of the original Lee sigma filter.},

MAC, and cross-layer protocols. Recently, there have been heightened privacy concerns over the data collected by and transmitted through WSNs. The wireless transmission
required by a WSN, and the self-organizing nature of its architecture, makes privacy protection for WSNs an especially challenging problem. This paper provides a state-of-theart
survey of privacy-preserving techniques for WSNs. In particular, we review two main categories of privacy-preserving techniques for protecting two types of private information,
data-oriented and context-oriented privacy, respectively. We also discuss a number of important open challenges for future research. Our hope is that this paper sheds some
light on a fruitful direction of future research for privacy preservation in WSNs.},

We focus on the task of locating reflective small regions using a level-set-based algorithm.

The curve evolves according to speckle statistics, initially propagating with a maximum upward velocity in homogeneous areas. Our approach is validated by a series of tests on synthetic and real SAR images and compared with three other segmentation algorithms, demonstrating that it configures a novel and efficient method for target-detection purpose.},

Before analyzing these images, it is often necessary to remove the speckle noise using filters. We combine properties of two mathematical morphology filters with speckle statistics to propose a signal-dependent noise filter to multiplicative noise. We describe a multiscale scheme that preserves sharp edges while it smooths homogeneous areas, by combining local statistics with two mathematical morphology filters: the alternating sequential and the self-dual reconstruction algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is less sensitive to varying window sizes when applied to simulated and real SAR images in comparison with standard filters.},

  Abstract                 = {Shape matching plays a prominent role in the comparison of similar structures. We present a unifying framework for shape matching that uses mixture models to couple both the shape representation and deformation. The theoretical foundation is drawn from information geometry wherein information matrices are used to establish intrinsic distances between parametric densities. When a parameterized probability density function is used to represent a landmark-based shape, the modes of deformation are automatically established through the information matrix of the density. We first show that given two shapes parameterized by Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), the well-known Fisher information matrix of the mixture model is also a Riemannian metric (actually, the Fisher-Rao Riemannian metric) and can therefore be used for computing shape geodesics. The Fisher-Rao metric has the advantage of being an intrinsic metric and invariant to reparameterization. The geodesicâcomputed using this metricâestablishes an intrinsic deformation between the shapes, thus unifying both shape representation and deformation. A fundamental drawback of the Fisher-Rao metric is that it is not available in closed form for the GMM. Consequently, shape comparisons are computationally very expensive. To address this, we develop a new Riemannian metric based on generalized},

  Abstract                 = {The advances in wireless communication, microelectronics, digital electronics, and highly integrated electronics and the increasing need for more efficient controlled electric systems make the development of monitoring and supervisory control tools the object of study of many researchers. This paper proposes a digital system for energy usage evaluation, condition monitoring, diagnosis, and supervisory control for electric systems applying wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with dynamic power management (DPM). The system is based on two hardware topologies responsible for signal acquisition, processing, and transmission: intelligent sensor modules (ISMs) and remote data acquisition units (RDAUs). The gateway function of the wired network is carried out by remote servers (RSs) based on the Soekris architecture, which is responsible for receiving the data collected and transmitting it to the supervisory controller (SC). To extend the WSN lifetime, sensor nodes implement a DPM protocol. The basic characteristics of the presented system are the following: 1) easy implementation; 2) low-cost implementation; 3) easy implementation of redundant routines (security); 4) portability/versatility; and 5) extended network lifetime.},

  Abstract                 = {Distance correlation is a new class of multivariate dependence coefficients applicable to random vectors of arbitrary and not necessarily equal dimension. Distance covariance and distance correlation are analogous to product-moment covariance and correlation, but generalize and extend these classical bivariate measures of dependence. Distance correlation characterizes independence: it is zero if and only if the random vectors are independent. The notion of covariance with respect to a stochastic process is introduced, and it is shown that population distance covariance coincides with the covariance with respect to Brownian motion; thus both can be called Brownian distance covariance. In the bivariate case, Brownian covariance is the natural extension of product-moment covariance, as we obtain Pearson product-moment covariance by replacing the Brownian motion in the definition with identity. The corresponding statistic has an elegantly simple computing formula. Advantages of applying Brownian covariance and correlation vs the classical Pearson covariance and correlation are discussed and illustrated.},

The main essence of the middleware is to simplify and accelerate the development of wireless healthcare applications by providing highly reusable codes. The architecture of the middleware including its main functions such as data acquisition, dynamic plug-and-play capabilities, on-the-fly sensor reconfiguration, and resource management (i.e., sensor sleep/wake-up, critical self-wake) will be discussed. A security feature as a means to protect critical sensor data from malicious/unauthorized parties has also been incorporated in our proposed middleware. The prototype system of the middleware has been built and is presented in this paper together with its performance measurements.},

The SPSR algorithm is featured by discerning pixels of similar structural patterns, which is crucial for a despeckling process to avoid blurring image structure. To alleviate the impact of speckle noise to similarity measure, a two-stage filtering scheme is introduced into the SPSR algorithm. Filtering at the first stage aims at an accurate approximation of true structural similarity, followed by the filtering at the second stage to group pixels with similar neighborhood in a large area. Compared to the traditional Lee filter, enhanced Lee filter and the speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD), evaluation results have shown that the SPSR algorithm substantially improves the despeckling performance especially on structure preservation and speckle reduction in homogeneous regions.},

The system can measure the distribution of irradiance and radiance over the sea surface, in the layer near sea surface and in the euphotic zone synchronously, during which some other parameters are also acquired such as spectral absorption and coefficients of the water column, the velocity and direction of the wind, and so on. The buoy was positioned by GPS. The low-power integrated PC104 computer was used as the control core to collect data automatically. The data and commands were real-timely transmitted by CDMA/GPRS wireless networks or by the maritime satellite. The coastal marine experimentation demonstrated that the buoy has small pitch and roll rates in high sea state conditions and thus can meet the needs of under-water radiometric measurements, the data collection and remote transmission are reliable, and the auto-operated anti-biofouling devices can ensure that the optical sensors work effectively for a period of several months.},

The MML and other criteria in the literature are compared in terms of their ability to estimate the number of clusters in a data set. The comparison utilizes synthetic and RADARSAT SAR images. The performance of our method is also tested by contextual evaluations involving SAR image segmentation and change detection.},

  Abstract                 = {The Cloude-Pottier radar polarimetry paradigm, which is understood as the spectral decomposition theorem of the target coherency matrix plus the classification technique based on the triad of parameters given by entropy, alpha angle, and anisotropy, has become a very well-established methodology for treating high-resolution polarimetric radar images, particularly those obtained with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors. This methodology is revisited here from the standpoint of the coherence and polarization theory and their mutual relationship, in the light of the interest aroused once again after Wolfâs article on this subject in 2003. Despite its success in terms of acceptance by the SAR community, the Cloude-Pottier paradigm relies on the arguable assumption that different scattering mechanisms can be separated by diagonalizing the aforementioned coherency matrix and then assigning each corresponding eigenvector to one of the independent scattering mechanisms. Our main statement in this paper is that the coherency matrix illustrates the behavior of the target from the point of view of polarization and not of full coherence, which would justify this assumption, even if only partially. Therefore, it is not rigorous to identify each eigenvector of this decomposition with a distinct scattering mechanism. Cloude and Pottier argue that the eigendecomposition of the coherency matrix outperforms other target decomposition theorems due to its uniqueness. It is also suggested that this very uniqueness, together with the orthogonality of the eigenvectors, supports the injective mapping between scattering mechanisms and eigenvectors that was first assumed based on statistical independence. With the aim of providing a comprehensive overview of the problem, we discuss some important concepts with regard to both field and target coherency matrices. In addition, we revise the concepts of entropy, alpha angle, and anisotropy as defined by the aforementioned authors, which are also a central part of this paradigm and which have played an important role in SAR image classification since its introduction. Again, some disagreement is found with the meaning of these parameters as they have been discussed so far.},

  Abstract                 = {There exist several methods for calculating the fractal dimension of objects represented as 2D digital images. For example, Box counting, Minkowski dilation or Fourier analysis can be employed. However, there appear to be some limitations. It is not possible to calculate only the fractal dimension of an irregular region of interest in an image or to perform the calculations in a particular direction along a line on an arbitrary angle through the image. The calculations must be made for the whole image. In this paper, a new method to overcome these limitations is proposed. 2D images are appropriately prepared in order to apply 1D signal analyses, originally developed to investigate nonlinear time series. The Higuchi dimension of these 1D signals is calculated using Higuchi's algorithm, and it is shown that both regions of interests and directional dependencies can be evaluated independently of the whole picture. A thorough validation of the proposed technique and a comparison of the new method to the Fourier dimension, a common two dimensional method for digital images, are given. The main result is that Higuchi's algorithm allows a direction dependent as well as direction independent analysis. Actual values for the fractal dimensions are reliable and an effective treatment of regions of interests is possible. Moreover, the proposed method is not restricted to Higuchi's algorithm, as any 1D method of analysis, can be applied.},

  Abstract                 = {The advent of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar has spurred a growing interest in statistical models for complex-valued covariance matrices, which is the common representation of multilook polarimetric radar images. In this paper, we respond to an emergent need by proposing statistical tests for the simple and composite goodness-of-fit (GoF) problem for a class of compound matrix distributions. The tests are based on Mellin-kind matrix cumulants. These are derived from a novel characteristic function for positive definite Hermitian random matrices, defined in terms of a matrix-variate Mellin transform instead of the conventional Fourier transform, and belong to a new framework for statistical analysis of multilook polarimetric radar data recently introduced by the authors. The cumulant-based tests are easy to compute, and the asymptotic sampling distribution of the test statistic is chi-square distributed in the simple hypothesis case. Under the composite hypothesis, the sampling distribution is obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. We evaluate the power of the proposed GoF tests with simulated data. We also use them to assess the fit of several matrix distributions to real data acquired by Radarsat-2 in fine-quad polarization mode.},

Based on the matrix-variate Mellin transform, an alternative characteristic function is defined, from which we can retrieve a new kind of matrix log-moments and log-cumulants. It is demonstrated that the matrix log-cumulants are of great value to analysis of polarimetric radar data, and that they can be used to derive estimators for the distribution parameters with low bias and variance.},

  abstract  = {Texture is one of the most important visual attributes for image analysis. It has been widely used in image analysis and pattern recognition. A partially self-avoiding deterministic walk has recently been proposed as an approach for texture analysis with promising results. This approach uses walkers (called tourists) to exploit the gray scale image contexts in several levels. Here, we present an approach to generate graphs out of the trajectories produced by the tourist walks. The generated graphs embody important characteristics related to tourist transitivity in the image. Computed from these graphs, the statistical position (degree mean) and dispersion (entropy of two vertices with the same degree) measures are used as texture descriptors. A comparison with traditional texture analysis methods is performed to illustrate the high performance of this novel approach.},

  Abstract                 = {As the number of operational wind scatterometers is getting smaller, other sources of spaceborne sensors are now included in global wind mapping. One of the prominent sensors is the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Besides serving as a generic scatterometer, SAR systems are the only type of radar systems that can provide sub-km resolution sea surface wind data and offers near shore mapping capability. This unique feature is important for assessing the offshore wind resources. As an important source of renewable energy, offshore wind farms are growing rapidly. Furthermore, recent research shows that the cross-polarization radar backscatter does not seem to saturate in high winds, and provides an excellent supplement for scatterometer wind sensing in storm conditions. The saturation issues of co-polarization radar returns have so far made it difficult to resolve wind speeds beyond roughly 20 m/s, or even less for lower incidence angles. The scope of this paper is to show the potential of RADARSAT-2's polarimetric modes for wind speed retrieval. RADARSAT-2 is the first operational fully polarimetric (HH VV HV VH) C-band satellite. Standard Quad-pol images have been collected in the St. Lawrence Gulf and compared against the Mont-Louis buoy and QuikSCAT scatterometer data. Co-polarization wind speeds were computed with CMOD-5 algorithms. A few polarization ratios were tested to determine the most suitable one for RADARSAT-2's HH polarization mode. For Cross-polarization, two different models were compared. Cross-polarization gives excellent results when wind exceeds 5 m/s. In general, SAR wind retrieval is suitable for resolution of 400 m.},

Taken into various elliptical choices, the multivariate Laplace and G0 distributions are introduced for modeling respectively the color cue and spatial dependencies of the wavelet coef- ficients. A multi-model classification approach is then pro- posed to combine the similarity measures. A comparative study between some multivariate models on the VisTex image database is conducted and reveals that the combination of the multivariate Laplace modeling for the color dependency and the multivariate G0 modeling for spatial one achieves higher recognition rates than other approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {A pretest approach based on the complex Wishart distribution in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) speckle filtering is proposed in this paper. The main principle is to select homogeneous pixels in a large-scale area in the filtering process, which is called pretesting. To preserve details and fine structures while despeckling, the homogeneous pixels are selected by comparing their 3 Ã 3 neighboring windows. A test statistic based on the complex Wishart distribution is used to decide the selection of homogeneous pixels. Speckle filtering is processed by summing up the homogeneous pixels with weights according to the values of their test statistics. To accelerate the pretest filter, we further propose a refined algorithm, which eliminates redundant operations without deteriorating the performance. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm by using both simulated and real airborne POLSAR data.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the early 20th century, the need for multivariate analysis has driven the development of various types of multivariate methods for applications ranging from social science to biomedical research. Multivariate data, as distinguished from univariate and multivariable data, consist of more than one outcome variable measured on a number of subjects. There exist exploratory data analysis methods that aim to extract, summarize, and visualize empirical data information for the 
purpose of formulating hypotheses as well as confirmatory data analysis methods that allow testing specific research questions and hypotheses. Major exploratory tools for dimension reduction and classification include principal component analysis, canonical correlation, exploratory factor analysis, discriminant, and cluster analysis. Advanced confirmatory modeling techniques encompass general linear multivariate model, mixed model, and structural equation model. This article aims to provide an overview of these methods as well as recent developments in the area of high dimension, low sample size analysis for data from high-throughput bioassays or high-resolution medical images.},

the ENL and the variance of the logarithm of the multiplicative noise is established. Then, for a SAR image, we first apply the logarithmic transform to make the multiplicative noise become additive. After that, the variance of the additive noise in the logarithmic image is estimated; finally, the ENL is obtained according to the estimated noise variance by the pre-established lookup table. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with both simulated and real SAR images.},

While higher-level methods consider image features such as edges or robust descriptors, low-level approaches compare groups of pixels (patches) and provide dense matching. Patch similarity is a key ingredient to many techniques for image registration, stereo-vision, change detection or denoising. A fundamental difficulty when comparing two patches from real data is to decide whether the differences should be ascribed to noise or intrinsic dissimilarity. Gaussian noise assumption leads to the classical definition of patch similarity based on the squared intensity differences. When the noise departs from the Gaussian distribution, several similarity criteria have been proposed in the literature. We review seven of those criteria taken from the fields of image processing, detection theory and machine learning. We discuss their theoretical grounding and provide a numerical comparison of their performance under Gamma and Poisson noises.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to facilitate teaching complex topics in an interactive way, the authors developed a computer-assisted teaching system, a graphical user interface named TGUI (Teaching Graphical User Interface). TGUI was introduced at the beginning of 2009 in the Austrian Journal of Statistics (Dinges and Templ 2009) as being an effective instrument to train and teach staff on mathematical and statistical topics. While the fundamental principles were retained, the current TGUI system has been undergone a complete redesign. The ultimate goal behind the reimplementation was to share the advantages of TGUI and provide teachers and people who need to hold training courses with a strong tool that can enrich their lectures with interactive features. The idea was to go a step beyond the current modular blended-learning systems (see, e.g., Da Rin 2003) or the related teaching techniques of classroom-voting (see, e.g., Cline 2006). In this paper the authors have attempted to exemplify basic idea and concept of TGUI by means of statistics seminars held at Statistics Austria. The powerful open source software R (R Development Core Team 2010a) is the backend for TGUI which can therefore be used to process even complex statistical contents. However, with specifically created contents the interactive TGUI system can be used to support a wide range of courses and topics. The open source R packages TGUICore and TGUITeaching are freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network at http://CRAN.R-project.org/.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides a novel pointwise-adaptive speckle filter based on local homogeneous-region segmentation with pixel-relativity measurement. A ratio distance is proposed to measure the distance between two speckled-image patches. The theoretical proofs indicate that the ratio distance is valid for multiplicative speckle, while the traditional Euclidean distance failed in this case. The probability density function of the ratio distance is deduced to map the distance into a relativity value. This new relativity-measurement method is free of parameter setting and more functional compared with the Gaussian kernel- projection-based ones. The new measurement method is success- fully applied to segment a local shape-adaptive homogeneous region for each pixel, and a simplified strategy for the segmen- tation implementation is given in this paper. After segmentation, the maximum likelihood rule is introduced to estimate the true signal within every homogeneous region. A novel evaluation metric of edge-preservation degree based on ratio of average is also provided for more precise quantitative assessment. The visual and numerical experimental results show that the proposed filter outperforms the existing state-of-the-art despeckling filters.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a detailed description and comparison of speckle reduction of medical ultrasound, and in particular echocardiography, is presented. Fifteen speckle reduction filters are described in a detailed fashion to facilitate implementation for research and evaluation. The filtering techniques considered include anisotropic diffusion, wavelet denoising, and local statistics. Common nomenclature and notation are adopted, to expedite comparison between approaches. Comparison of the filters is based on their application to simulated images, clinical videos, and a computational requirement analysis. The ultrasound simulation method provides a realistic model of the image acquisition process, and permits the use of a noise-free reference image for comparison. Application of objective quality metrics quantifies the preservation of image edges, overall image distortion, and improvement in image contrast. The computational analysis quantifies the number of operations required for each speckle reduction method. A speed-accuracy analysis of discretization methods for anisotropic diffusion is included. It is concluded that the optimal method is the OSRAD diffusion filter. This method is capable of strong speckle suppression, increasing the average SNRA of the simulated images by a factor of two. This method also shows favorable edge preservation and contrast improvement, and may be efficiently implemented.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a general approach for high- resolution polarimetric SAR data classification in heterogeneous clutter, based on a statistical test of equality of covariance matrices. The Spherically Invariant Random Vector (SIRV) model is used to describe the clutter. Several distance measures, including classical ones used in standard classification methods, can be derived from the general test. The new approach provide a threshold over which pixels are rejected from the image, meaning they are not sufficiently #x201C;close #x201D; from any existing class. A distance measure using this general approach is derived and tested on a high-resolution polarimetric data set acquired by the ONERA RAMSES system. It is compared to the results of the classical $H-alpha $ decomposition and Wishart classifier under Gaussian and SIRV assumption. Results show that the new approach rejects all pixels from heterogeneous parts of the scene and classifies its Gaussian parts.},

The analysis shows that a statistically adequate model for the tree backscattering amplitude can be presented as a mixture of generalized gamma or lognormal distribution, and the mixture model can be reduced to a single density model if the trees with trunk volumes exceeding an appropriate threshold are to be taken into account. The generalized gamma density is shown to provide an appreciably better fit to the exceedance functions associated with the PO model data than that for the lognormal density. The results can be used to design statistically adequate models of forest clutter for VHF synthetic aperture radar systems.},

Q, indeed the crucial SCM ingredient, is cast in terms of an associated distance D. Since out input data consists of time-series, we also discuss the best way of extracting from the time series a probability distribution P.

Several frequently used computational modules (building blocks of PVQMs) are discussed. These include signal decomposition, just-noticeable distortion, visual attention, and common feature and artifact detection. Afterwards, different types of existing PVQMs are presented, and further discussion is given toward feature pooling, viewing condition, computer-generated signal and visual attention. Six often-used image metrics (namely SSIM, VSNR, IFC, VIF, MSVD and PSNR) are also compared with seven public image databases (totally 3832 test images). We highlight the most significant research work for each topic and provide the links to the extensive relevant literature.},

  Abstract                 = {With wireless sensor networks, preserving battery life is critical. For such sensors, data collection is relatively cheap while data transmission is relatively expensive. For such networks in ecological settings, certain processes are sufficiently predictable so that transmission of data at a particular time can be suppressed if it does not differ from what is expected at that time. That is, there will not be much loss of information with regard to inference. More precisely, there is a presumed model to explain the measurements collected at the sensors, which provides insight into what is expected at a given node, at a given time. Under the suppression, inference objectives include both estimation of the process parameters as well as reconstruction of the entire time series at each of the nodes.
In this paper, we build on the existing literature that has offered ways in which one can use suppression in wireless sensor networks to limit the number of transmissions. We introduce a new, computationally cheap, locally linear suppression scheme based upon process knowledge and compare it to the commonly used âconstantâ suppression scheme. Maintaining the same suppression threshold, we demonstrate decreased transmission rates under the new scheme while producing comparable posterior inference relative to constant suppression scheme. That is, the untransmitted readings are bounded to within an interval of the same length under both schemes, but the linear suppression scheme will transmit less data.
We implement this scheme for a synthetic dataset produced under the as- sumption of a diffusion model and show that even under high suppression rates, we are able to recover simulation parameters. We also implement lin- ear suppression on data collected from a real wireless sensor network that measures the amount of light filtering through the forest canopy at a set of locations in the Duke Forest. We show that the in-sample predictive sum of squared errors from the suppressed data is only a bit larger than that from the full dataset.},

  Abstract                 = {The exponentiated exponential distribution, a most attractive generalization of the exponential distribution, introduced by Gupta and Kundu (Aust. N. Z. J. Stat. 41:173â188, 1999 ) has received widespread attention. It appears, however, that many mathematical properties of this distribution have not been known or have not been known in simpler/general forms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the mathematical properties. We derive expressions for the moment generating function, characteristic function, cumulant generating function, the n th moment, the first four moments, variance, skewness, kurtosis, the n th conditional moment, the first four cumulants, mean deviation about the mean, mean deviation about the median, Bonferroni curve, Lorenz curve, Bonferroni concentration index, Gini concentration index, RÃ©nyi entropy, Shannon entropy, cumulative residual entropy, Songâs measure, moments of order statistics, L moments, asymptotic distribution of the extreme order statistics, reliability, distribution of the sum of exponentiated exponential random variables, distribution of the product of exponentiated exponential random variables and the distribution of the ratio of exponentiated exponential random variables. We also discuss estimation by the method of maximum likelihood, including the case of censoring, and provide simpler expressions for the Fisher information matrix than those given by Gupta and Kundu. It is expected that this paper could serve as a source of reference for the exponentiated exponential distribution and encourage further research.},

  abstract  = {Complex elliptically symmetric (CES) distributions constitute a flexible and broad class of distributions for many engineering applications and include the widely used complex Gaussian, complex -, complex generalized Gaussian and sym- metric -stable distributions for example. Their careful statistical characterization is needed. Moreover, the mechanisms for gen- erating random variables from these distributions are not well defined in literature. In this paper we provide such treatment in order to provide a better insight on their statistical properties and simplifying proofs and derivations. For example, insightful expressions for complex kurtosis coefficients of CES distributions are derived providing an interpretation on what complex kurtosis really measures. Also derived are asymptotic distributions of cir- cularity measures, the sample circularity quotient and coefficient, assuming i.i.d. samples from an unspecified CES distribution. Also new Waldâs type detectors of circularity are proposed that are valid within CES distributions with finite fourth-order moments. These results are accompanied with examples that are of interest in developing signal processing algorithms for complex-valued signals.},

  Abstract                 = {The change-detection problem can be viewed as an unsupervised classification problem with two classes corresponding to changed and unchanged areas. Image differencing is a widely used approach to change detection. It is based on the idea of generating a difference image that represents the modulus of the spectral change vectors associated with each pixel in the study area. To separate out the changed and unchanged classes in the difference image automatically, any unsuper- vised technique can be used. Thresholding is one of the cheapest techniques among them. However, in thresholding approaches, selection of the best threshold value is not a trivial task. In this work, several non-fuzzy and fuzzy histogram threshold- ing techniques are investigated and compared for the change-detection problem. Experimental results, carried out on different multitemporal remote sensing images (acquired before and after an event), are used to assess the effectiveness of each of the thresholding techniques. Among all the thresholding techniques investigated here, Liuâs fuzzy entropy followed by Kapurâs entropy are found to be the most robust techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we study maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the roughness parameter of the distribution for speckled imagery (Frery et al., 1997). We discover that when a certain criterion is satisfied by the sample moments, the likelihood function is monotone and MLE estimates are infinite, implying an extremely homogeneous region. We implement three corrected estimators in an attempt to obtain finite parameter estimates. Two of the estimators are taken from the literature on monotone likelihood ([Firth, 1993] and [Jeffreys, 1946]) and one, based on resampling, is proposed by the authors. We perform Monte Carlo experiments to compare the three estimators. We find the estimator based on the Jeffreys prior to be the worst. The choice between Firth's estimator and the Bootstrap estimator depends on the value of the number of looks (which is given before estimation) and the specific needs of the user. We also apply the estimators to real data obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR). These results corroborate the Monte Carlo findings. Further clarification of the choice between the Firth and Bootstrap estimators will be obtained through future studies of the classification properties of these estimators.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the Rao geodesic distance (GD) based on the Fisher information as a similarity measure on the manifold of zero-mean multivariate generalized Gaus- sian distributions (MGGD). The MGGD is shown to be an adequate model for the heavy-tailed wavelet statistics in multicomponent images, such as color or multispectral im- ages. We discuss the estimation of MGGD parameters us- ing various methods. We apply the GD between MGGDs to color texture discrimination in several classification experiments, taking into account the correlation structure be- tween the spectral bands in the wavelet domain. We compare the performance, both in terms of texture discrimination capability and computational load, of the GD and the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Likewise, both uni- and multivariate generalized Gaussian models are evalu- ated, characterized by a fixed or a variable shape parameter. The modeling of the interband correlation significantly improves classification efficiency, while the GD is shown to consistently outperform the KLD as a similarity mea- sure.},

The projected data can be rendered as densities or histograms, scatterplots, anaglyphs, glyphs, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, time series or images, and viewed using an R graphics device, passed to GGobi, or saved to disk. A tour path can be stored for visualisation or replay. With this package it is possible to quickly experiment with different, and new, approaches to tours of data.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel class of self-organizing sensing agents that adaptively learn an anisotropic, spatio-temporal Gaussian process using noisy measurements and move in order to improve the quality of the estimated covariance function. This approach is based on a class of anisotropic covariance functions of Gaussian processes introduced to model a broad range of spatio-temporal physical phenomena. The covariance function is assumed to be unknown a priori. Hence, it is estimated by the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimator. The prediction of the field of interest is then obtained based on the MAP estimate of the covariance function. An optimal sampling strategy is proposed to minimize the information-theoretic cost function of the Fisher Information Matrix. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the adaptability of the proposed scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {The brightness of a SAR image is affected by topog- raphy due to varying projection between ground and image coordinates. For polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) imagery being used for purposes of land cover classification, this radiometric variability is shown to affect the outcome of a Wishart unsupervised classification in areas of moderate topography. The intent of this paper is to investigate the impact of applying a radiometric correction to the PolSAR coherency matrix for a region of boreal forest in interior Alaska. The gamma naught radiometric correction estimates the local illuminated area at each grid point in the radar geometry. Then, each element of the coherency matrix is divided by the local area to produce a polarimetric product that is radiometrically ``flat.'' This paper follows two paths, one with and one without ra- diometric correction, to investigate the impact upon classification accuracy. Using a Landsat-derived land cover reference, the radiometric correction is shown to bring about significant qualitative and quantitative improvements in the land cover map. Confusion matrix analysis confirms the accuracy for most classes and shows a 15% improvement in the classification of the deciduous forest class.},

We call this new denoising algorithm the Non-Local Euclidean Medians (NLEM). At the heart of NLEM is the observation that the median is more robust to outliers than themean. In particular, we provide a simple geometric insight that explains why NLEM performs better than
NLM in the vicinity of edges, particularly at large noise levels. NLEM can be efficiently implemented using iteratively reweighted least squares, and its computational complexity is comparable to that of NLM. We provide some preliminary results to study the proposed algorithm and to compare it with NLM.},

  abstract  = {The art of fitting gamma distributions robustly is described. In particular we compare methods of fitting via minimizing a Cramér Von Mises distance, an L2 minimum distance estimator, and fitting a B-optimal M-estimator. After a brief prelude on robust estimation explaining the merits in terms of weak continuity and Fréchet differentiability of all the aforesaid estimators from an asymptotic point of view, a comparison is drawn with classical estimation and fitting. In summary, we give a practical example where minimizing a Cramér Von Mises distance is both efficacious in terms of efficiency and robustness as well as being easily implemented. Here gamma distributions arise naturally for "in control": representation indicators from measurements of spectra when using fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. However, estimating the in-control parameters for these distributions is often difficult, due to the occasional occurrence of outliers.},

  Abstract                 = {Many tasks in computer vision require to match image parts. While higher-level methods consider image features such as edges or robust descriptors, low-level approaches (so-called image-based) compare groups of pixels (patches) and provide dense matching. Patch similarity is a key ingredient to many techniques for image registration, stereo-vision, change detection or denoising. Recent progress in natural image modeling also makes intensive use of patch comparison. A fundamental difficulty when comparing two patches from "real" data is to decide whether the differences should be ascribed to noise or intrinsic dissimilarity. Gaussian noise assumption leads to the classical definition of patch similarity based on the squared differences of intensities. For the case where noise departs from the Gaussian distribution, several similarity criteria have been proposed in the literature of image processing, detection theory and machine learning. By expressing patch (dis)similarity as a detection test under a given noise model, we introduce these criteria with a new one and discuss their properties. We then assess their performance for different tasks: patch discrimination, image denoising, stereo-matching and motion-tracking under gamma and Poisson noises. The proposed criterion based on the generalized likelihood ratio is shown to be both easy to derive and powerful in these diverse applications.},

We provide a fast algorithm to compute the NL-Means with arbitrary shapes thanks to the Fast Fourier Transform. We then consider local combinations of the estimators associated with various shapes by using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE). Experimental results show that this algorithm improve the standard NL-Means performance and is close to state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of visual quality and numerical results. Moreover, common visual artifacts usually observed by denoising with NL-Means are reduced or suppressed thanks to our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-channel systems appear in several fields of application in science. In the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) context, multi-channel systems may refer to different domains, as multi-polarization, multi-interferometric or multi-temporal data, or even a combination of them. Due to the inherent speckle phenomenon present in SAR images, the statistical description of the data is almost mandatory for its utilization. The complex images acquired over natural media present in general zero-mean circular Gaussian characteristics. In this case, second order statistics as the multi-channel covariance matrix fully describe the data. For practical situations however, the covariance matrix has to be estimated using a limited number of samples, and this sample covariance matrix follow the complex Wishart distribution. In this context, the eigendecomposition of the multi-channel covariance matrix has been shown in different areas of high relevance regarding the physical properties of the imaged scene. Specifically, the maximum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix has been frequently used in different applications as target or change detection, estimation of the dominant scattering mechanism in polarimetric data, moving target indication, etc. In this paper, the statistical behavior of the maximum eigenvalue derived from the eigendecomposition of the sample multi-channel covariance matrix in terms of multi-channel SAR images is simplified for SAR community. Validation is performed against simulated data and examples of estimation and detection problems using the analytical expressions are as well given.},

  Abstract                 = {Artificial thermal mixing of the water column is a common method of addressing water quality problems with the most popular method of destratification being the bubble curtain. The air or oxygen distribution along submerged multiport diffusers is based on similar basic principles as those of outfall disposal systems. Moreover, the disposal of sequestered greenhouse gases into the ocean, as recently proposed by several researchers to mitigate the global warming problem, requires analogous design criteria. In this paper, the influence of a bubble-plume is evaluated using full-scale temperature and water quality data collected in San Roque Reservoir, Argentina. A composite system consisting of seven separated diffusers connected to four 500 kPa compressors was installed at this reservoir by the end of 2008. The original purpose of this air bubble system was to reduce the stratification, so that the water body may completely mix under natural phenomena and remain well oxygenated throughout the year. By using a combination of the field measurements and modelling, this work demonstrates that thermal mixing by means of compressed air may improve water quality; however, if improperly sized or operated, such mixing can also cause deterioration. Any disruption in aeration during the destratification process, for example, may result in a reduction of oxygen levels due to the higher hypolimnetic temperatures. Further, the use of artificial destratification appears to have insignificant influence on reducing evaporation rates in relatively shallow impoundments such as San Roque reservoir.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a robust radial basis function (RBF) network based classifier is proposed for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed feature extraction process utilizes the covariance matrix elements, the H/a/A decomposition based features combined with the backscattering power (span), and the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features, which are projected onto a lower dimensional feature space using principal components analysis. For the classifier training, both conventional backpropagation (BP) and multidimensional particle swarm optimization (MD-PSO) based dynamic clustering are explored. By combining complete polarimetric covariance matrix and eigenvalue decomposition based pixel values with textural information (contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity) in the feature set, and employing automated evolutionary RBF classifier for the pattern recognition unit, the overall classification performance is shown to be significantly improved. An experimental study is performed using the fully polarimetric San Francisco Bay and Flevoland data sets acquired by the NASA/ Jet Propulsion Laboratory Airborne SAR (AIRSAR) at L-band to evaluate the performance of the proposed classifier. Classification results (in terms of confusion matrix, overall accuracy and classification map) compared with the major state of the art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RBF network classifier.},

We consider GA0 distribution parameters for SAR image segmentation, combined to the level set framework. The GA0 distribution belongs to a class of G distributions that have been successfully used to model different regions in amplitude SAR images for data modeling purpose. Such statistical data model is fundamental to deriving the energy functional to perform region mapping, which is input into our level set propagation numerical scheme that splits SAR images into homogeneous, heterogeneous, and extremely heterogeneous regions. Moreover, we introduce an assessment procedure based on stochastic distance and the GA0 model to quantify the robustness and accuracy of our approach. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithms regarding experiments on synthetic and real SAR data.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a natural scene statistic-based distortion-generic blind/no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) model that operates in the spatial domain. The new model, dubbed blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE) does not compute distortion-specific features, such as ringing, blur, or blocking, but instead uses scene statistics of locally normalized luminance coefficients to quantify possible losses of "naturalness" in the image due to the presence of distortions, thereby leading to a holistic measure of quality. The underlying features used derive from the empirical distribution of locally normalized luminances and products of locally normalized luminances under a spatial natural scene statistic model. No transformation to another coordinate frame (DCT, wavelet, etc.) is required, distinguishing it from prior NR IQA approaches. Despite its simplicity, we are able to show that BRISQUE is statistically better than the full-reference peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index, and is highly competitive with respect to all present-day distortion-generic NR IQA algorithms. BRISQUE has very low computational complexity, making it well suited for real time applications. BRISQUE features may be used for distortion-identification as well. To illustrate a new practical application of BRISQUE, we describe how a nonblind image denoising algorithm can be augmented with BRISQUE in order to perform blind image denoising. Results show that BRISQUE augmentation leads to performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. A software release of BRISQUE is available online: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/BRISQUE_release.zip for public use and evaluation.},

In this paper, we propose the usage of the Harmonic, Geometric and Arithmetic temporal means for amplitude statistical studies along time. In general, the arithmetic mean is used to compute the mean amplitude of time series. In this study, we will show that comparing the behaviour of the Harmonic, Geometric and Arithmetic means, enables a change detection method along SAR time series.},

Without these stronger notions of convergence, the asymptotic approximations to the coverage probability or size may be poor, even in very large samples.

  Abstract                 = {Imputation of missing data in large regions of satellite imagery is necessary when the acquired image has been damaged by shadows due to clouds, or information gaps produced by sensor failure. The general approach for imputation of missing data, which could not be considered missed at random, suggests the use of other available data. Previous work, like local linear histogram matching, takes advantage of a co-registered older image obtained by the same sensor, yielding good results in filling homogeneous regions, but poor results if the scenes being combined have radical differences in target radiance due, for example, to the presence of sun glint or snow. This study proposes three different alternatives for filling the data gaps. The first two involves merging radiometric information from a lower resolution image acquired at the same time, in the Fourier domain (Method A), and using linear regression (Method B). The third method considers segmentation as the main target of processing, and proposes a method to fill the gaps in the map of classes, avoiding direct imputation (Method C). All the methods were compared by means of a large simulation study, evaluating performance with a multivariate response vector with four measures: Q, RMSE, Kappa and Overall Accuracy coefficients. Differences in performance were tested with a MANOVA mixed model design with two main effects, imputation method and type of lower resolution extra data, and a blocking third factor with a nested sub-factor, introduced by the real Landsat image and the sub-images that were used. Method B proved to be the best for all criteria.},

To exploit redundancy existing in multi-temporal images, we develop a new strategy of NLM for multi-temporal data. Instead of directly overspreading the NLM operator from one image to temporal images, a two steps weighted average is proposed in this paper. The first step is a maximum likelihood estimate with binary weights on temporal pixels and the second step is iterative NL means on spatial pixels. Experiments in this paper illustrate that the proposed method can effectively exploit image redundancy and denoise multi-temporal images.},

  Abstract                 = {A new similarity measure and nonlocal filters for images corrupted by multiplicative noise are presented. The considered filters are generalizations of the nonlocal means filter of Buades et al., which is known to be well suited for removing additive Gaussian noise. To adapt this filter to different noise models, the involved patch comparison has first of all to be performed by a suitable noise dependent similarity measure. For this purpose, a recently proposed probabilistic measure for general noise models by Deledalle et al. is studied. This measure is analyzed in the context of conditional density functions and its properties are examined for data corrupted by additive and multiplicative noise. Since it turns out to have unfavorable properties for multiplicative noise, a new similarity measure is deduced consisting of a probability density function specially chosen for this type of noise. The properties of this new measure are studied theoretically as well as by numerical experiments. To finally obtain nonlocal filters, a weighted maximum likelihood estimation framework is applied, which also incorporates the noise statistics. Moreover, the weights occurring in these filters are defined using the new similarity measure and different adaptations are proposed to further improve the results. Finally, restoration results for images corrupted by multiplicative Gamma and Rayleigh noise are presented to demonstrate the very good performance of these nonlocal filters.},

  Abstract                 = {With its weather- and illumination-independent characteristics, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become an important tool for change detection. There are two critical steps in SAR image change detection: designing a change detector and choosing a decision rule. Given a measure from a change detector, the change detection results could be sensitive to the decision rule, such as the selection of a threshold. This letter presents a change detection measure based on a likelihood ratio and the statistical distribution of SAR intensity images. The likelihood ratio is defined as the ratio between the joint probability density functions (PDFs) of a pair of SAR images. Under the condition that both PDFs follow the gamma distribu- tion, the histogram of this change detection measure deduced from the likelihood ratio has a single and steep peak that can be used to reliably and easily determine the change detection threshold. Analyses of SAR image pairs from different plat- forms show that the proposed change detection measure is simple and effective in detecting changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Impulse noise detection is a critical issue when removing impulse noise and impulse/Gaussian mixed noise. In this paper, we propose a new detection mechanism for universal noise and a universal noise-filtering framework based on the nonlocal means (NL-means). The operation is carried out in two stages, i.e., detection followed by filtering. For detection, first, we propose the robust outlyingness ratio (ROR) for measuring how impulselike each pixel is, and then all the pixels are divided into four clusters according to the ROR values. Second, different decision rules are used to detect the impulse noise based on the absolute deviation to the median in each cluster. In order to make the detection results more accurate and more robust, the from-coarse-to-fine strategy and the iterative framework are used. In addition, the detection procedure consists of two stages, i.e., the coarse and fine detection stages. For filtering, the NL-means are extended to the impulse noise by introducing a reference image. Then, a universal denoising framework is proposed by combining the new detection mechanism with the NL-means (ROR-NLM). Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed noise detector is superior to most existing detectors, and the ROR-NLM produces excellent results and outperforms most existing filters for different noise models. Unlike most of the other impulse noise filters, the proposed ROR-NLM also achieves high peak signal-to-noise ratio and great image quality by efficiently removing impulse/Gaussian mixed noise.},

The proposed parameter ADoR is based on the degrees of polarization of the scattered waves using orthogonally polarized incident waves. Combining the ADoR and the Freeman decomposition, which is applied to discriminate the dominant scattering mechanism of the target, a new scheme for unsupervised classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is designed. Considering that the preset intervals of the randomness measure may not fit the data distribution, an iterative classification method is developed. The effectiveness of the randomness measure and the proposed methods is demonstrated using a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) AIRborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) PolSAR image. },

  Abstract                 = {Cook's distance [Technometrics 19 (1977) 15-18] is one of the most important diagnostic tools for detecting influential individual or subsets of observations in linear regression for cross-sectional data. However, for many complex data structures (e.g., longitudinal data), no rigorous approach has been developed to address a fundamental issue: deleting subsets with different numbers of observations introduces different degrees of perturbation to the current model fitted to the data, and the magnitude of Cook's distance is associated with the degree of the perturbation. The aim of this paper is to address this issue in general parametric models with complex data structures. We propose a new quantity for measuring the degree of the perturbation introduced by deleting a subset. We use stochastic ordering to quantify the stochastic relationship between the degree of the perturbation and the magnitude of Cook's distance. We develop several scaled Cook's distances to resolve the comparison of Cook's distance for different subset deletions. Theoretical and numerical examples are examined to highlight the broad spectrum of applications of these scaled Cook's distances in a formal influence analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The brightness of a SAR image is affected by topog- raphy due to varying projection between ground and image coordinates. For polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) imagery being used for purposes of land cover classification, this radiometric variability is shown to affect the outcome of a Wishart unsupervised classification in areas of moderate topography. The intent of this paper is to investigate the impact of applying a radiometric correction to the PolSAR coherency matrix for a region of boreal forest in interior Alaska. The gamma naught radiometric correction estimates the local illuminated area at each grid point in the radar geometry. Then, each element of the coherency matrix is divided by the local area to produce a polarimetric product that is radiometrically ``flat.'' This paper follows two paths, one with and one without ra- diometric correction, to investigate the impact upon classification accuracy. Using a Landsat-derived land cover reference, the radiometric correction is shown to bring about significant qualitative and quantitative improvements in the land cover map. Confusion matrix analysis confirms the accuracy for most classes and shows a 15% improvement in the classification of the deciduous forest class.},

In particular, we provide a simple geometric insight that explains why NLEM performs better than
NLM in the vicinity of edges, particularly at large noise levels. NLEM can be efficiently implemented using iteratively reweighted least squares, and its computational complexity is comparable to that of NLM. We provide some preliminary results to study the proposed algorithm and to compare it with NLM.},

In particular we compare methods of fitting via minimizing a Cramér Von Mises distance, an L2 minimum distance estimator, and fitting a B-optimal M-estimator. After a brief prelude on robust estimation explaining the merits in terms of weak continuity and Fréchet differentiability of all the aforesaid estimators from an asymptotic point of view, a comparison is drawn with classical estimation and fitting. In summary, we give a practical example where minimizing a Cramér Von Mises distance is both efficacious in terms of efficiency and robustness as well as being easily implemented. Here gamma distributions arise naturally for "in control": representation indicators from measurements of spectra when using fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. However, estimating the in-control parameters for these distributions is often difficult, due to the occasional occurrence of outliers.},

  Abstract                 = {Many tasks in computer vision require to match image parts. While higher-level methods consider image features such as edges or robust descriptors, low-level approaches (so-called image-based) compare groups of pixels (patches) and provide dense matching. Patch similarity is a key ingredient to many techniques for image registration, stereo-vision, change detection or denoising. Recent progress in natural image modeling also makes intensive use of patch comparison. A fundamental difficulty when comparing two patches from "real" data is to decide whether the differences should be ascribed to noise or intrinsic dissimilarity. Gaussian noise assumption leads to the classical definition of patch similarity based on the squared differences of intensities. For the case where noise departs from the Gaussian distribution, several similarity criteria have been proposed in the literature of image processing, detection theory and machine learning. By expressing patch (dis)similarity as a detection test under a given noise model, we introduce these criteria with a new one and discuss their properties. We then assess their performance for different tasks: patch discrimination, image denoising, stereo-matching and motion-tracking under gamma and Poisson noises. The proposed criterion based on the generalized likelihood ratio is shown to be both easy to derive and powerful in these diverse applications.},

We then consider local combinations of the estimators associated with various shapes by using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE). Experimental results show that this algorithm improve the standard NL-Means performance and is close to state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of visual quality and numerical results. Moreover, common visual artifacts usually observed by denoising with NL-Means are reduced or suppressed thanks to our approach.},

According to the maximum entropy characterization theorem, the deviation from Gaussian statistics can be quantified as a reduction of the Shannon entropy.

An experiment demonstrates the information contents associated with the nonGaussian entropy component.},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-channel systems appear in several fields of application in science. In the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) context, multi-channel systems may refer to different domains, as multi-polarization, multi-interferometric or multi-temporal data, or even a combination of them. Due to the inherent speckle phenomenon present in SAR images, the statistical description of the data is almost mandatory for its utilization. The complex images acquired over natural media present in general zero-mean circular Gaussian characteristics. In this case, second order statistics as the multi-channel covariance matrix fully describe the data. For practical situations however, the covariance matrix has to be estimated using a limited number of samples, and this sample covariance matrix follow the complex Wishart distribution. In this context, the eigendecomposition of the multi-channel covariance matrix has been shown in different areas of high relevance regarding the physical properties of the imaged scene. Specifically, the maximum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix has been frequently used in different applications as target or change detection, estimation of the dominant scattering mechanism in polarimetric data, moving target indication, etc. In this paper, the statistical behavior of the maximum eigenvalue derived from the eigendecomposition of the sample multi-channel covariance matrix in terms of multi-channel SAR images is simplified for SAR community. Validation is performed against simulated data and examples of estimation and detection problems using the analytical expressions are as well given.},

  Abstract                 = {Artificial thermal mixing of the water column is a common method of addressing water quality problems with the most popular method of destratification being the bubble curtain. The air or oxygen distribution along submerged multiport diffusers is based on similar basic principles as those of outfall disposal systems. Moreover, the disposal of sequestered greenhouse gases into the ocean, as recently proposed by several researchers to mitigate the global warming problem, requires analogous design criteria. In this paper, the influence of a bubble-plume is evaluated using full-scale temperature and water quality data collected in San Roque Reservoir, Argentina. A composite system consisting of seven separated diffusers connected to four 500 kPa compressors was installed at this reservoir by the end of 2008. The original purpose of this air bubble system was to reduce the stratification, so that the water body may completely mix under natural phenomena and remain well oxygenated throughout the year. By using a combination of the field measurements and modelling, this work demonstrates that thermal mixing by means of compressed air may improve water quality; however, if improperly sized or operated, such mixing can also cause deterioration. Any disruption in aeration during the destratification process, for example, may result in a reduction of oxygen levels due to the higher hypolimnetic temperatures. Further, the use of artificial destratification appears to have insignificant influence on reducing evaporation rates in relatively shallow impoundments such as San Roque reservoir.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a robust radial basis function (RBF) network based classifier is proposed for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed feature extraction process utilizes the covariance matrix elements, the H/a/A decomposition based features combined with the backscattering power (span), and the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features, which are projected onto a lower dimensional feature space using principal components analysis. For the classifier training, both conventional backpropagation (BP) and multidimensional particle swarm optimization (MD-PSO) based dynamic clustering are explored. By combining complete polarimetric covariance matrix and eigenvalue decomposition based pixel values with textural information (contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity) in the feature set, and employing automated evolutionary RBF classifier for the pattern recognition unit, the overall classification performance is shown to be significantly improved. An experimental study is performed using the fully polarimetric San Francisco Bay and Flevoland data sets acquired by the NASA/ Jet Propulsion Laboratory Airborne SAR (AIRSAR) at L-band to evaluate the performance of the proposed classifier. Classification results (in terms of confusion matrix, overall accuracy and classification map) compared with the major state of the art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RBF network classifier.},

We consider GA0 distribution parameters for SAR image segmentation, combined to the level set framework. The GA0 distribution belongs to a class of G distributions that have been successfully used to model different regions in amplitude SAR images for data modeling purpose. Such statistical data model is fundamental to deriving the energy functional to perform region mapping, which is input into our level set propagation numerical scheme that splits SAR images into homogeneous, heterogeneous, and extremely heterogeneous regions. Moreover, we introduce an assessment procedure based on stochastic distance and the GA0 model to quantify the robustness and accuracy of our approach. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithms regarding experiments on synthetic and real SAR data.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a natural scene statistic-based distortion-generic blind/no-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) model that operates in the spatial domain. The new model, dubbed blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE) does not compute distortion-specific features, such as ringing, blur, or blocking, but instead uses scene statistics of locally normalized luminance coefficients to quantify possible losses of "naturalness" in the image due to the presence of distortions, thereby leading to a holistic measure of quality. The underlying features used derive from the empirical distribution of locally normalized luminances and products of locally normalized luminances under a spatial natural scene statistic model. No transformation to another coordinate frame (DCT, wavelet, etc.) is required, distinguishing it from prior NR IQA approaches. Despite its simplicity, we are able to show that BRISQUE is statistically better than the full-reference peak signal-to-noise ratio and the structural similarity index, and is highly competitive with respect to all present-day distortion-generic NR IQA algorithms. BRISQUE has very low computational complexity, making it well suited for real time applications. BRISQUE features may be used for distortion-identification as well. To illustrate a new practical application of BRISQUE, we describe how a nonblind image denoising algorithm can be augmented with BRISQUE in order to perform blind image denoising. Results show that BRISQUE augmentation leads to performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. A software release of BRISQUE is available online: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/BRISQUE_release.zip for public use and evaluation.},

  Abstract                 = {Imputation of missing data in large regions of satellite imagery is necessary when the acquired image has been damaged by shadows due to clouds, or information gaps produced by sensor failure. The general approach for imputation of missing data, which could not be considered missed at random, suggests the use of other available data. Previous work, like local linear histogram matching, takes advantage of a co-registered older image obtained by the same sensor, yielding good results in filling homogeneous regions, but poor results if the scenes being combined have radical differences in target radiance due, for example, to the presence of sun glint or snow. This study proposes three different alternatives for filling the data gaps. The first two involves merging radiometric information from a lower resolution image acquired at the same time, in the Fourier domain (Method A), and using linear regression (Method B). The third method considers segmentation as the main target of processing, and proposes a method to fill the gaps in the map of classes, avoiding direct imputation (Method C). All the methods were compared by means of a large simulation study, evaluating performance with a multivariate response vector with four measures: Q, RMSE, Kappa and Overall Accuracy coefficients. Differences in performance were tested with a MANOVA mixed model design with two main effects, imputation method and type of lower resolution extra data, and a blocking third factor with a nested sub-factor, introduced by the real Landsat image and the sub-images that were used. Method B proved to be the best for all criteria.},

To exploit redundancy existing in multi-temporal images, we develop a new strategy of NLM for multi-temporal data. Instead of directly overspreading the NLM operator from one image to temporal images, a two steps weighted average is proposed in this paper. The first step is a maximum likelihood estimate with binary weights on temporal pixels and the second step is iterative NL means on spatial pixels. Experiments in this paper illustrate that the proposed method can effectively exploit image redundancy and denoise multi-temporal images.},

  Abstract                 = {A new similarity measure and nonlocal filters for images corrupted by multiplicative noise are presented. The considered filters are generalizations of the nonlocal means filter of Buades et al., which is known to be well suited for removing additive Gaussian noise. To adapt this filter to different noise models, the involved patch comparison has first of all to be performed by a suitable noise dependent similarity measure. For this purpose, a recently proposed probabilistic measure for general noise models by Deledalle et al. is studied. This measure is analyzed in the context of conditional density functions and its properties are examined for data corrupted by additive and multiplicative noise. Since it turns out to have unfavorable properties for multiplicative noise, a new similarity measure is deduced consisting of a probability density function specially chosen for this type of noise. The properties of this new measure are studied theoretically as well as by numerical experiments. To finally obtain nonlocal filters, a weighted maximum likelihood estimation framework is applied, which also incorporates the noise statistics. Moreover, the weights occurring in these filters are defined using the new similarity measure and different adaptations are proposed to further improve the results. Finally, restoration results for images corrupted by multiplicative Gamma and Rayleigh noise are presented to demonstrate the very good performance of these nonlocal filters.},

  Abstract                 = {With its weather- and illumination-independent characteristics, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become an important tool for change detection. There are two critical steps in SAR image change detection: designing a change detector and choosing a decision rule. Given a measure from a change detector, the change detection results could be sensitive to the decision rule, such as the selection of a threshold. This letter presents a change detection measure based on a likelihood ratio and the statistical distribution of SAR intensity images. The likelihood ratio is defined as the ratio between the joint probability density functions (PDFs) of a pair of SAR images. Under the condition that both PDFs follow the gamma distribu- tion, the histogram of this change detection measure deduced from the likelihood ratio has a single and steep peak that can be used to reliably and easily determine the change detection threshold. Analyses of SAR image pairs from different plat- forms show that the proposed change detection measure is simple and effective in detecting changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Impulse noise detection is a critical issue when removing impulse noise and impulse/Gaussian mixed noise. In this paper, we propose a new detection mechanism for universal noise and a universal noise-filtering framework based on the nonlocal means (NL-means). The operation is carried out in two stages, i.e., detection followed by filtering. For detection, first, we propose the robust outlyingness ratio (ROR) for measuring how impulselike each pixel is, and then all the pixels are divided into four clusters according to the ROR values. Second, different decision rules are used to detect the impulse noise based on the absolute deviation to the median in each cluster. In order to make the detection results more accurate and more robust, the from-coarse-to-fine strategy and the iterative framework are used. In addition, the detection procedure consists of two stages, i.e., the coarse and fine detection stages. For filtering, the NL-means are extended to the impulse noise by introducing a reference image. Then, a universal denoising framework is proposed by combining the new detection mechanism with the NL-means (ROR-NLM). Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed noise detector is superior to most existing detectors, and the ROR-NLM produces excellent results and outperforms most existing filters for different noise models. Unlike most of the other impulse noise filters, the proposed ROR-NLM also achieves high peak signal-to-noise ratio and great image quality by efficiently removing impulse/Gaussian mixed noise.},

The proposed parameter ADoR is based on the degrees of polarization of the scattered waves using orthogonally polarized incident waves. Combining the ADoR and the Freeman decomposition, which is applied to discriminate the dominant scattering mechanism of the target, a new scheme for unsupervised classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images is designed. Considering that the preset intervals of the randomness measure may not fit the data distribution, an iterative classification method is developed. The effectiveness of the randomness measure and the proposed methods is demonstrated using a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) AIRborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) PolSAR image. },

  Abstract                 = {Cook's distance [Technometrics 19 (1977) 15-18] is one of the most important diagnostic tools for detecting influential individual or subsets of observations in linear regression for cross-sectional data. However, for many complex data structures (e.g., longitudinal data), no rigorous approach has been developed to address a fundamental issue: deleting subsets with different numbers of observations introduces different degrees of perturbation to the current model fitted to the data, and the magnitude of Cook's distance is associated with the degree of the perturbation. The aim of this paper is to address this issue in general parametric models with complex data structures. We propose a new quantity for measuring the degree of the perturbation introduced by deleting a subset. We use stochastic ordering to quantify the stochastic relationship between the degree of the perturbation and the magnitude of Cook's distance. We develop several scaled Cook's distances to resolve the comparison of Cook's distance for different subset deletions. Theoretical and numerical examples are examined to highlight the broad spectrum of applications of these scaled Cook's distances in a formal influence analysis.},

  abstract  = {Time-series (TS) are employed in a variety of academic disciplines. In thispaper we focus on extracting probability density functions (PDFs) from TS to gain aninsight into the underlying dynamic processes. On discussing this "extraction" problem,we consider two popular approaches that we identify as histograms and BandtPompe. Weuse an information-theoretic method to objectively compare the information content of theconcomitant PDFs.},
