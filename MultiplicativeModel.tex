\chapter{The Multiplicative Model}\label{Chapter:MultiplicativeModel}

The Multiplicative Model is one of the infinitely many ways to build stochastic descriptions for SAR data.
Among its advantages we would like to mention that it can be considered an \textit{ab initio} model, and that it leads to expressive and tractable descriptions of the data.

Let us recall that the basic model for multilook intensity data is the $\Gamma(\sigma^2,L)$ law whose density is
\begin{equation}
f_Z(z;L,\sigma^2) = \frac{L^L}{\sigma^{2L}\Gamma(L)} z^{L-1} 
	\exp\big\{ -L z / \sigma^2
	\big\}.
\end{equation}
As previously said, the Gamma distribution is scale-invariant, so we may pose this model as the product between the constant backscatter $X=\sigma^2$ and the multilook speckle $Y\sim\Gamma(1,L)$.
